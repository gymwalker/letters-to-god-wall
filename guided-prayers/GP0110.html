<h2>A Prayer for When You’ve Been Betrayed</h2>

<p>God, I didn’t see it coming — and maybe that’s what hurts the most. I trusted them. I let them in. I believed the words, the promises, the closeness… and then it broke. And now I’m left sitting in the wreckage of what used to be, trying to make sense of how it fell apart. Betrayal doesn’t just hurt — it shatters.</p>

<p>My heart is heavy with pain and confusion. I keep asking why. I keep replaying the conversations. I keep wondering if I should’ve seen it sooner. Part of me wants to forget — and part of me can’t stop remembering. This wound is deep. And I don’t know how to move forward with it… or in spite of it.</p>

<p>But God, I know You understand. You were betrayed too — by one of Your own, with a kiss. You know the sting of trust broken. You know what it feels like to be abandoned, denied, and turned against. So I come to You not just as my healer, but as someone who truly gets it.</p>

<p>I bring You my hurt. My anger. My disbelief. I bring You the need for justice and the cry for healing. I bring You the part of me that wants to harden — and the part of me that still hopes for something redemptive. God, I don’t want this pain to define me. I want You to.</p>

<p>Teach me how to forgive — not because what they did was okay, but because I don’t want to be tethered to this forever. Give me the courage to name the wound, and then give me the grace to release it. Help me to forgive in layers if I need to — over time, in prayer, with You walking me through every step of it.</p>

<p>Restore what was broken in me. Rebuild my trust — in You, in others, in myself. Guard my heart from bitterness. And help me want what You want — not revenge or silence, but healing and freedom. I know You can turn even this into something that makes me stronger, softer, and more like Jesus.</p>

<p>So I give You the betrayal. I give You the hurt, the tears and the tightness in my chest. I give You the names, the memories, the ache, the pain. Do what only You can do with it. Make something holy out of this heartbreak.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
