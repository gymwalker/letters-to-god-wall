<h2>A Prayer for When You’ve Lost Someone</h2>

<p>God, this hurts more than I know how to say. I’ve lost someone I loved deeply — and the ache in my chest feels like it might never go away. The world keeps moving forward, but I feel stuck in this place of sorrow. I miss them. I miss what we had. I miss who I was when they were here.</p>

<p>There are so many things I didn’t get to say. So many moments I wish I could relive. The memories are sweet and painful all at once. I thank You for the time I had with them, but I’m struggling with the fact that it ended. I don’t understand why it happened like this. I don’t understand why it hurts so much. And I don’t know how to carry this grief without being swallowed by it.</p>

<p>So I come to You with open hands and a broken heart. I lay this loss at Your feet. You are the God who sees. The God who weeps. The God who knows what it is to lose someone You love. Jesus, You stood outside the tomb and wept — so I know You understand. You don’t rush me past my pain. You sit with me in it. You hold me when I can’t hold myself together.</p>

<p>Help me to grieve in Your presence, not in isolation. Help me to feel what I need to feel — not to numb it, but to walk through it with You. I know grief isn’t something I “get over.” It’s something I carry, and I need You to help me carry it well.</p>

<p>Father, when the waves of sorrow hit, speak peace to my soul. When guilt or regret creep in, cover me in Your grace. When the emptiness feels overwhelming, remind me that You are near. You are Emmanuel — God with me — even here.</p>

<p>And when the time comes, gently show me how to laugh again. How to dream again. How to live with both memory and hope. Help me to honor their life with how I live mine. And help me to want what You want: a heart that draws closer to You in every season — even the painful ones.</p>

<p>Thank You for holding my sorrow. Thank You for promising eternal life. Thank You that this goodbye is not the end of the story. And thank You that even in loss… I am not lost to You.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
