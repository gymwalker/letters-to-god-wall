<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Facing a Big Decision</h2>

<p>Father, You already know the choice in front of me and how much it’s weighing on my heart. I’ve been turning it over in my mind, playing out every outcome, and trying to figure out what the “right” answer is. But what I need most is You—not just direction, but peace, clarity, and courage. I don’t want to make this decision apart from You. In fact, I want You to make it simple for me—give me one choice and only one choice. Sometimes, I'm not the brightest in the world. That’s why I need simple, not complicated. Simple.</p>

<p>Help me slow down long enough to hear Your voice above the noise. I don’t want to rush ahead, and I don’t want to freeze in fear. I want to move in step with You. If I’m being pulled toward something that isn’t from You, close the door—even if it disappoints me. And if You’re leading me toward something that feels uncomfortable or uncertain, or risky, give me the faith to trust You more than my feelings.</p>

<p>Remind me that I’m not trying to choose between “good” and “bad” options, but between paths that can either draw me closer to You—or pull me away. That’s what I care about most. I want to make a decision that honors You, reflects Your heart, and aligns with Your will.</p>

<p>So here I am, God. I surrender my plans, my timelines, and my expectations. Guide me in a way that leaves no room for doubt—not because I need a sign, but because Your peace will guard my heart and confirm the way. And if I make a mistake, remind me that You are still with me. You are not limited by my decisions—you are faithful to lead me forward no matter what.</p>

<p>More than anything, I want what You want—a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. Help me choose the path that keeps me near to You, even if it costs me something. That’s a price I’m willing to pay. Thank You for being my guide, my anchor, and the One who walks with me through every decision I face.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
