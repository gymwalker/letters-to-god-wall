<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Weary of Waiting</h2>

<p>God, I’ve been waiting for so long. Waiting for healing. Waiting for breakthrough. Waiting for answers. Waiting for You to move. And even though I’ve tried to stay patient, honest truth? I’m tired. I’m discouraged. I'm frustrated. I’m starting to wonder if I misunderstood You — or worse, if You’ve forgotten me.</p>

<p>There are days I can push through. But today… today I’m weary. My hope feels thin, my prayers feel tired, and my faith is being stretched farther than I ever thought it could go. I don’t want to walk away, but I don’t know how to keep standing still without losing heart.</p>

<p>So here I am — again — bringing You my questions, my frustration, my longing. Not because I have nowhere else to go, but because I know You’re still the only One who can meet me here. You’re not angry at my weariness. You’re not threatened by my doubt. You’re still good, even when life doesn’t feel like it. And I still believe You’re working, even when I can’t see it.</p>

<p>God, remind me that waiting is not wasted. It's one of the ways You use to build trust, patience, and perserverance. I know these are all good things for me to have. Help me to hold on and to trust what You are doing. Help me to see the good in the waiting. To see that You’re doing something in me, not just around me. That delay is not denial, and silence is not absence. Help me to trust that You are not withholding good from me — You’re preparing something good for me. And You’re preparing me for it, too. Please help me to cooperate with You and not fight what You are trying to do.</p>

<p>Give me strength for this stretch of the journey. Give me fresh hope — not manufactured optimism, but real, rooted, deep-in-my-bones hope that’s anchored in who You are. Give me grace to keep showing up, to keep seeking, to keep surrendering this timeline to You.</p>

<p>Most of all, help me want what You want. A strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You — not just a breakthrough, not just an answered prayer, but more of You, less of me. Let this season of waiting draw me nearer to Your heart than I’ve ever been.</p>

<p>I trust You, even when I’m tired. I believe You’re still writing something beautiful. And I choose to wait — with You.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
