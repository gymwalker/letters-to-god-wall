<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Feeling Lost</h2>

<p>God, I feel like I’m wandering. I don’t know where I’m going, and I don’t know how I got so turned around. There was a time I felt so close to You—so certain. But now it’s like the map has gone blank, and my heart can’t find north. I need You to come find me, Lord. I don’t need a spotlight—I just need to know You’re near.</p>

<p>You’ve promised never to leave me or forsake me, but sometimes it’s hard to feel that when I’m stumbling in the dark. Remind me that Your presence doesn’t depend on my feelings. Remind me that even when I feel lost, I am still held. Still known. Still loved.</p>

<p>I don’t want to wander in circles, chasing purpose or answers or rescue from the wrong places. Help me stop running to other things for comfort or identity. Call me back to You. Bring me home again—not just physically, but spiritually and emotionally too. Re-center me, God.</p>

<p>Show me that being lost is not the end of the story. Sometimes You let us lose our way just so we’ll reach for Your hand again. So I’m reaching now. Even if I don’t know the way forward, I trust You’ll walk it with me—and that’s what matters most.</p>

<p>I want what You want — a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. Thank You for never letting go of me. Thank You for being the Shepherd who always comes after the one who’s wandered.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
