<h2>A Prayer of Thanksgiving</h2>

<p>God, thank You. I don’t want to rush into this moment without saying that first. Thank You — for who You are, for what You’ve done, for how You’ve carried me. Thank You for the ways You’ve shown up that I didn’t even recognize at the time. Thank You for the breath in my lungs, the grace I wake up to, and the mercy that meets me every morning.</p>

<p>I don’t want to take anything for granted. You’ve given me more than I deserve, more than I’ve noticed, and more than I’ll ever be able to repay. Even when life has been hard, You’ve never stopped being good. Even when I’ve been ungrateful, unappreciative, You’ve never stopped being generous. You are the giver of every good and perfect gift — and I want to be someone who notices those gifts and gives You the glory for them. Who runs back and says Thank You!</p>

<p>Thank You for Your patience with me. For Your forgiveness. For the cross. For the empty tomb. For the Holy Spirit living inside of me. For the eternal life you've given me. Thank You for loving me when I was hard to love. For pursuing me when I wasn’t pursuing You. For believing in me when I couldn’t even believe in myself.</p>

<p>Help me to live with a heart that overflows with gratitude — not just in the good moments, but in every moment. Help me to look around and see the blessings I’ve overlooked. Help me to give thanks in all circumstances, not because life is always easy, but because You are always worthy. And when I get distracted by worry, fear, or comparison, pull my heart back to thankfulness. Show me how to develop a habit of praise, a lifestyle of gratitude, and a mindset that sees Your hand in everything.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just a list of answered prayers, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where thanksgiving becomes my rhythm, my love language, my default posture. One where gratitude fuels my worship, shapes my attitude, and draws me closer to Your heart every single day.</p>

<p>Thank You for being so good. So loving. So caring. So kind. So faithful. You deserve all the honor, all the praise, all the credit, and all my worship.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
