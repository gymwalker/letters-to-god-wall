<h2>A Prayer to Overcome Anger</h2>

<p>God, I’m angry — and I don’t always know what to do with it. Sometimes it flares up fast, and other times it simmers just beneath the surface. But it’s there. I feel it in my chest, in my jaw, in my thoughts. And I know it’s hurting more than just me. It’s affecting my words, my relationships, and my witness.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to manage it. I’ve tried to justify it. I’ve tried to stuff it down. I've even tried to ignore it. But it always finds a way to come out — often in ways I regret. God, I’m tired of being controlled by my emotions. I don’t want anger to have the final word. I want You to have the final word.</p>

<p>So I bring it to You now. Not just the outbursts, but the roots. The frustration. The wounds. The fear. The disappointment. The pride. The sense of injustice. The parts of me that feel unheard, unseen, unappreciated, or unloved. I lay it all before You, God, because You already see it — and You know what to do with it better than I ever could.</p>

<p>Father, help me to understand that anger is not a primary emotion, it is a secondary emotion. So, when I feel anger rising up, teach me to slow down and breathe. To evaluate my emotions. To seek out the root of what I'm feeling. Is it frustration? Is it disappointment? Is it discouragement?Whatever it is, help me to identify it and deal directly with that emotion, and understand why that emotion is there. And to choose not to let anger rule and reign over me. But rather, to pray over the emotioin and release it. To not fight flesh with flesh, but to fight flesh with Spirit, Your Spirit that lives within me.</p>
  
<p>Help me to always choose Your Spirit instead of my flesh. Help me be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry — not because I’m suppressing the truth, but because I’m surrendering to You.</p>

<p>Heal the places in me that anger has taken root. Help me to forgive what still feels unfair. Help me release what I’ve held onto for too long. Let my anger drive me to prayer, not to sin. Let it drive me to truth, not destruction. Let it be a signal that I need more of You, not more control.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just behavior change, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where Your peace rules in my heart, and Your Spirit leads my response. One where love is stronger than pride, patience is stronger than irritation, and grace is stronger than rage.</p>

<p>Thank You for being patient with me. Thank You for not being afraid of my anger, and for loving me through it. I surrender it to You now, Lord. Make me more like Jesus — even in the heat of the moment.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
