<h2>A Prayer for Letting Go of Shame</h2>

<p>God, shame has been my shadow for too long. It follows me into quiet moments and loud rooms. It shows up in how I see myself, how I talk to myself, how I hide from others — and sometimes, how I hide from You. I know I’ve been forgiven… but part of me still lives like I haven’t. And I’m tired of carrying this weight.</p>

<p>So today, I choose to bring it into the light. The memories, the regrets, the things I can’t believe I did — or allowed. The parts of my story I’d rather erase. I offer them all to You. Not because they’re easy to let go of, but because I know You never asked me to carry them in the first place.</p>

<p>Your Word says there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. So why do I keep condemning myself? Why do I keep listening to the voice of the accuser when You call me redeemed, restored, and loved?</p>

<p>God, teach me how to live forgiven. Not just in theory — but in truth. Let grace become more than a concept. Let it become my reality. Help me to silence shame with Your voice of love. Help me to stop identifying with who I used to be and start embracing who I am now — a new creation in Christ.</p>

<p>Rewire my thinking. Heal the places where shame has taken root. Break every agreement I’ve made with the lie that I am unworthy, unlovable, or disqualified. Remind me, again and again, that You don’t see me through the lens of what I’ve done — You see me through the lens of what Jesus has done for me.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just freedom from my past, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where shame no longer keeps me at a distance, but where love draws me closer every single day.</p>

<p>Thank You for covering me. Thank You for choosing me. Thank You for not being ashamed of me — even when I was ashamed of myself.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
