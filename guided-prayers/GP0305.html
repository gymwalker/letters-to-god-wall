<h2>A Prayer for When You Need Direction</h2>

<p>Lord, I’m standing at a crossroads and I don’t know which way to go. There are options in front of me, but I don’t want to move without You. I’ve asked for signs, I’ve looked for clarity, and I’ve even tried to map it all out on my own—but I still feel stuck. What I need most right now is Your direction, not my own strategy or assumptions.</p>

<p>Your Word says that if I trust in You with all my heart and don’t lean on my own understanding, You will make my paths straight. So I’m choosing to trust—even when the way isn’t obvious. Even when I don’t have all the details. Even when fear tries to cloud my judgment. I believe You have a plan for me, and I want to walk in it fully, not halfway.</p>

<p>If I’m hesitating out of fear, give me boldness. If I’m running ahead of You, slow me down. If I’m chasing something that’s not part of Your will, close the door firmly and redirect my steps. I don’t want to be led by convenience or comfort—I want to be led by You.</p>

<p>God, I know You’ve never failed me before. You’ve guided people through deserts, through storms, through silence—and You’ll guide me too. Even if it’s just one step at a time, I’ll follow. Speak to me in ways I can understand. Surround me with godly counsel. Stir something in my spirit that confirms the direction You want me to take.</p>

<p>And through it all, remind me why direction matters—because more than getting it “right,” I want what You want: a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. That’s the path I want most. One that leads me closer to Your heart.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
