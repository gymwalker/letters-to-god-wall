<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Struggling with Self-Harm or Dark Thoughts</h2>

<p>God, I don’t know what to do with all this pain. Sometimes it feels like too much to carry. The thoughts in my head are loud… dark… overwhelming. I feel stuck, trapped in a cycle of shame, fear, and hurt that I can’t seem to escape. And sometimes I wonder if it would be easier to just make it all stop — even if it hurts to do it.</p>

<p>I’m not proud of the things I’ve done to cope. The ways I’ve tried to feel something… or to feel nothing. I'm not trying to justify what I do, but, it is strange how the self-harm gives me temporary relief even as it leaves scars. Scars that run deep. There are secrets I’ve kept and pain I’ve tried to bury. But You see it all, don’t You? Every scar. Every moment. Every tear. You see the war inside me — and You’re not turning away.</p>

<p>So here I am, Lord. With shaking hands and a hurting heart, I bring it to You. I lay this at Your feet. I don’t even have the words, but You know what I’m trying to say. I need You. I don't want this life anymore. I need Your light to break through this darkness. I need Your love to drown out the lies. I need Your comfort in this deep ache I don’t know how to name. I want freedom from this. I need to know that I’m not alone… that You’re still here… and that there’s still hope for someone like me.</p>

<p>God, remind me that my pain is not too much for You. That my thoughts don’t scare You. That You’re not waiting for me to pull it together before I can come close. You came close first. You entered into my suffering. You bore my grief. You carried my sorrow. And You’re still carrying me — even now.</p>

<p>Help me to reach out for help — even if it feels awkward, even if I’m scared, even if I don’t know what to say. Lead me to people who will listen with compassion and speak truth with grace. Give me courage to open up and let someone in. Use their kindness to remind me that I matter. That I’m not invisible. That my life has value — because You gave it to me.</p>

<p>God, I want what You want — not just survival, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I can bring even the darkest parts of myself and know I’m still loved. One where healing isn’t rushed, but real. One where Your light slowly, steadily, lovingly begins to shine in the places I thought would always be dark.</p>

<p>Thank You for not giving up on me. Thank You for staying when I feel unworthy. Thank You for holding on when I’m barely holding on at all. I trust You, even in this. I trust that there is still more ahead — and that You will walk with me every step of the way.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
