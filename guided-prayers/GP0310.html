<h2>A Prayer for When You Need Wisdom</h2>

<p>God, I need Your wisdom. Not just more information. Not more opinions. Not what the world calls “smart.” I need the kind of wisdom that only comes from You — pure, peaceable, and full of grace. I’m standing at a crossroads, and I don’t want to move forward based on fear, pride, pressure or confusion. I want to walk in step with You.</p>

<p>There are voices pulling at me in every direction — my own thoughts, other people’s expectations, even the fear of missing out. Quiet all of it, Lord. Let Your voice rise above the noise. Give me clarity where I feel confused. Give me insight where I feel blind. Show me what honors You, even if it costs me something. Give my Your peace. Your Shalom peace. Your perfect peace and the wisdom that goes along with it.</p>

<p>Your Word says that if I lack wisdom, I should ask — and that You give it generously, without finding fault. So here I am, asking. Not just for answers, but for understanding. Not just for a quick fix, but for the kind of wisdom that will shape who I am becoming in You.</p>

<p>Help me recognize the difference between what seems right and what *is* right. Help me to wait if waiting is wise. Help me to speak only what builds up, to act with integrity, and to stay rooted in truth even when it’s hard. I don’t want to lean on my own understanding. I want to trust You with all my heart — and follow wherever You lead.</p>

<p>I want what You want — a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. Let Your wisdom lead me into that relationship more deeply than ever before, because knowing You *is* the beginning of all wisdom.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
