<h2>A Prayer for When God Feels Silent</h2>

<p>God, I miss You. I know You haven’t left, but I can’t hear You right now. I pray… and it feels like my words fall flat. I seek… and it feels like I’m met with stillness. I read… and the words blur together. And though I’ve walked with You long enough to know better, I still wonder: Have I done something wrong? Have You pulled away? Is there some sin You are wanting me to deal with?</p>

<p>Like King David, my heart is crying out, "How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?" But deep down, I know the truth — You’re still here. Still close. Still working. Still loving me. I'm just having a really difficult time feeling You right now. You’re not punishing me with silence. You’re drawing me into a deeper kind of trust. A kind of faith that isn’t built on feelings or emotional highs, but on the solid rock of who You are. You’re teaching me to believe even when I don’t hear or feel. To follow even when I don’t see. To love You not just for what You say, but for who You are. To worship you in spite of my feelings, my emotions. To be grateful regardless of how I feel at the time.</p>

<p>So in this quiet, help me not to drift. Help me not to chase noise or distractions to fill the space. Help me to stay — to sit in the silence, to rest in Your presence even when it’s not loud or obvious. Remind me that some of the most sacred moments happen in the stillness. That You often whisper, not shout. That growth is happening beneath the surface even if I can’t see it yet.</p>

<p>Teach me to press in instead of pulling away. To read Your Word not just for answers, but for connection. To continue to invest in my relationship with You. To worship not because I feel it, but because You are worthy. To pray not for performance, but for presence. Lead me to resources that will help me navigate this season — books, teachings, mentors, and Scripture that anchor me in truth. Help me to keep seeking You, not because I feel lost, but because You are the only One worth finding.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just spiritual highs or answered prayers, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One that knows how to wait well. One that remains faithful in the quiet. One that is unshakable, even in silence.</p>

<p>Thank You for not leaving. Thank You for working in the unseen. Thank You for loving me enough to grow my faith, even through the silence. I trust You. I believe You’re still speaking… and I’ll be right here, listening.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
