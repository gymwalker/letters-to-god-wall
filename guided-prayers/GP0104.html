<h2>A Prayer for Heartbreak</h2>

<p>God, my heart is broken. It wasn’t supposed to turn out this way. I gave my love, my trust, my hope — and now I’m left holding the pieces. The ache runs deep, and I don’t know how to move forward. Sometimes I can barely breathe beneath the weight of it all. I didn’t think I’d be here. And yet here I am, grieving what could have been, what should have been… what’s now lost.</p>

<p>You know the whole story, Lord — every detail, every disappointment, every tear I haven’t even cried yet. You saw the moment things fell apart. And You’ve seen every moment since. When I feel like I’m falling apart, remind me: You’re not. You are steady. You are close. You are loving. You are caring. You are kind — even when life doesn’t feel that way.</p>

<p>I don’t want to become bitter. I don’t want this pain to harden me. I want You to heal me — not just patch me up, but truly, deeply, wholly restore me. Father please, do whatever it takes to unbreak my heart. You say You’re close to the brokenhearted. So please, be close to me now. Hold the fragile parts of me with care. Rebuild what I can’t fix. Whisper truth when all I hear is regret or rejection or lies.</p>

<p>Teach me how to forgive — not just the person who hurt me, but also myself. There are so many “what ifs” and “should haves” swirling in my mind. Quiet those voices. Replace them with grace. I don’t have the strength to let go of this heartbreak on my own… but You are strong enough. And You are gentle enough.</p>

<p>God, I give You my questions. I give You my anger. I give You my sadness. I give you my hurt. I give You the love I don’t know where to place anymore. Help me to trust that You can redeem even this. That You can turn this season of sorrow into something that draws me closer to You — not further away. That somehow, through the ashes, You’ll breathe life into me again.</p>

<p>I still believe in love, because I believe in You. And even if my heart doesn’t feel whole right now, I know You are the Healer of hearts. You are not finished with my story. And You are not leaving me in this pain. Help me to want what You want. To find joy again. And to fall more in love with You — even through the tears.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
