<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Battling Depression</h2>

<p>God, I feel so heavy. There’s a weight I can’t explain — a darkness I can’t seem to shake. Some days it’s hard to get out of bed, hard to care, hard to hope, hard to desire or want anything good. I smile when I have to, but inside I feel numb, dead, or worse, like I’m drowning in sadness I can’t put into words.</p>

<p>I know You’re there, but sometimes it feels like You’re silent. I know You’re good, but I struggle to see it right now. I know You love me, but I feel unworthy of it. And the voice in my head keeps telling me lies — that I’m broken beyond repair, that nothing will ever change, that no one cares, that I am unloved, and even worse that I'm unlovable. But God, I know You love me, I know You care for me. Even if no one else cares or desires to understand, You do.</p>

<p>But here I am, bringing it all to You anyway. Because even in this darkness, I believe You are still the light. Even when I can’t feel You, I believe You are still near. Even when hope feels out of reach, I believe You are still the source of it. And even though I don’t have the strength to climb out of this pit on my own, I know You can lift me — gently, patiently, faithfully — one breath at a time.</p>

<p>God, please speak truth into the silence. Quiet the lies of the enemy. Break the shame I feel about feeling this way. Show me that I’m not weak for struggling — that even David, Elijah, Job, and others in Your Word walked through valleys like this. And You met them there… just like You’re meeting me now.</p>

<p>Surround me with people who won’t judge or try to fix me, but who will sit with me, pray for me, and remind me that I’m not alone. Help me ask for help when I need it. Help me to take one small step at a time — whether that’s reaching out, resting, opening my Bible, going for a walk and talking with You, or just breathing and being honest with You.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just relief from this pain, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One that clings to You in the dark and trusts You to bring the morning. One where my feelings don’t lead, but where Your truth anchors me — even when I can’t see past the fog.</p>

<p>Thank You for staying close to the brokenhearted, those battling depression, those who are in despair. Thank You for not rushing me. Thank You for being loving, patient, caring, and kind. I trust that You’re still writing my story — and You’re not finished yet.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
