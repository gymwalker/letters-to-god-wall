<h2>A Prayer for When You're Struggling</h2>

<p>God, I feel like I’m carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders. Everything feels heavy—my circumstances, my thoughts, my emotions. It’s like I’m stuck in the middle of a storm, and I can’t find my footing.</p>

<p>I know You are near, even when I can’t feel You. I know You’re working, even when I can’t see it. Help me remember that truth when everything inside me feels uncertain and afraid.</p>

<p>You say Your strength is made perfect in weakness. So here I am—weak, weary, and worn out. Meet me here, Lord. Fill in the gaps where I’ve got nothing left to give. Remind me that I don’t have to carry this alone.</p>

<p>Even in the middle of my struggle, I choose to trust You. I choose to believe that You ARE still good, still faithful, still with me. When my own faith feels too small, let me lean on Yours. When I don't have the strength to continue, fill me with Yours. When I can’t hold on any longer, hold on to me.</p>

<p>God, I surrender the pressure to have it all together. I give You my fear, my frustration, my exhaustion. Teach me how to rest in You. Teach me how to breathe again, trust again, and hope again—even if nothing changes right away.</p>

<p>Thank You for being patient with me. Thank You for not walking away from my mess. Thank You for loving me right here, even in the struggle. I believe You’ll carry me through this—because You always do.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
