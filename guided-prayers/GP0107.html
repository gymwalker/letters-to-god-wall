<h2>A Prayer for When You’ve Been Rejected</h2>

<p>God, I didn’t think it would hurt this much. I knew rejection was possible, but I wasn’t prepared for how deep it would cut. I gave my time, my trust, my heart — and they walked away. Whether it was slow or sudden, loud or silent… they made it clear I wasn’t wanted. And that truth stings more than I can explain.</p>

<p>Now I keep replaying the words, the silence, the moment it all shifted. I wonder what I did wrong. I wonder what I could’ve done differently. I wonder if I’ll ever be enough for anyone. This rejection makes me feel like I’m not worthy of love — like I’m too much or not enough, all at the same time.</p>

<p>But God, I bring those lies to You. I bring my bruised identity and shattered confidence. I bring the ache of being left out, pushed aside, or replaced. You know what it’s like to be rejected — by friends, by family, by the very people You came to save. You don’t dismiss this pain. You understand it.</p>

<p>Remind me, Lord, that their rejection is not my reflection. It doesn’t define my value. It doesn’t erase my purpose. It doesn’t cancel the love You have for me. You chose me. You wanted me. You called me Your own — not because I earned it, but because Your love is faithful, unconditional, and everlasting.</p>

<p>Heal the places that were wounded by their words or their absence. Speak truth where lies have taken root. And help me forgive — not because they deserve it, but because I don’t want to stay tied to their decisions. Free me, Lord. Let Your acceptance carry more weight than their rejection ever could.</p>

<p>God, help me to want what You want. To keep seeking You even when others turn away. To believe that You’re writing a story in my life that no one can take from me. That I am still chosen, still pursued, still deeply loved — by You.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
