<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Afraid to Hope Again</h2>

<p>God, I want to hope… but I’m scared. I’ve hoped before, and it hurt when things didn't turn out the way I wanted them to. I’ve prayed with faith, believed for a miracle, waited with expectation — and watched it fall apart. I’ve stood on promises, only to feel like the ground gave way beneath me. And now, even though something inside me still wants to hope again, another part of me holds back… remembering how You've let me down in the past, afraid to be disappointed one more time.</p>

<p>I know that You are good. I know that You are faithful. I’ve seen it, even tasted it in seasons past. And that should be enough, but this wound is still healing, and the fear of hoping again feels almost heavier than the fear of letting go. I don’t want to be cynical. I don’t want to live guarded. But I also don’t want to be shattered again. To trust and have You let me down, again. Can You meet me here, Lord? In this fragile, in-between space where my heart wants to rise but my soul is scared to move?</p>

<p>Father, I know the problem isn't You, it can only be me. You are perfect, holy, righteous, true, total and absolute goodness. You can only do good, you will do nothing but good, and can be nothing but good. I know this. Which means, my perspective of You and my past situations are distorted. Help me to see clearly, help me to let go of my disappointment, my discouragement, my frustration, my pain, and my fear of hoping in you again. Forgive me for these flaws and help me do better at seeing things from Your perspective.</p>

<p>You are the God who resurrects what looks dead. Who speaks life where there’s only silence. Who creates beauty out of ashes. Help me believe that truth again — not just in theory, but in my own story. Help me believe that hoping in You is never wasted, even when the outcome doesn’t look the way I wanted. Teach me to hope for more of You — not just what You can do, but who You are. Not just the outcome, but the relationship.</p>

<p>Heal the parts of me that stopped dreaming. Heal the places in me that gave up without saying it out loud. Heal the fear that makes me brace for disappointment instead of trusting You with expectation. Lead me to scriptures, songs, messages, and people who will rebuild hope in me. Remind me that hope isn’t a gamble — not when it’s rooted in You. You are the anchor of my soul, not the risk.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just a life of safety and self-protection, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I dare to believe again. One where hope grows not out of guarantees, but out of love. One where I trust You enough to dream again — and surrender those dreams back to You.</p>

<p>Thank You for being gentle with my heart. For not rushing me. For holding space for my pain and still whispering, “Come closer.” I choose to trust You… and I choose to hope again.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
