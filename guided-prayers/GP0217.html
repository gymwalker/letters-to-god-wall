<h2>A Prayer for When You Feel Spiritually Attacked</h2>

<p>God, I feel like I’m under siege. A battle is raging all around me. The pressure is rising. The lies are loud. The discouragement is thick. And it’s more than just a bad day — it feels like war. I know we wrestle not against flesh and blood, and that there’s a real enemy who seeks to steal, kill, and destroy. But God, sometimes the battle feels bigger than what I can handle.</p>

<p>I’m tired. I’m distracted. I feel disoriented and overwhelmed. I can’t always tell where the attack is coming from — or why it’s hitting so hard. But I know this: You are still God. You are still on the throne. And even in this battle, I am still Yours.</p>

<p>So I run to You, Lord — not with fear, but with faith. I put on the full armor You’ve given me: the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the gospel of peace on my feet, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is Your Word. I add these additional weapons — one I’m using right now — prayer, the praise and worship of You, and the most powerful weapon of all, the blood of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I will not fight with human weapons. I will stand firm in Your strength, clothed in Your truth, covered by Your grace.</p>

<p>I rebuke every lie of the enemy in the name of Jesus. I reject every whisper of fear, shame, accusation, confusion, and condemnation. I declare that no weapon formed against me shall prosper. I declare that greater is He who is in me than he who is in the world. I declare that the enemy is defeated — not because of who I am, but because of who You are, and because of the blood of the Lamb. I ask You, Lord Jesus, to bind, rebuke, and cast down any devil, demon, or demonic force that is harassing me. I ask that You would paralyze them with the absolute fear and terror of You, Lord Jesus. I ask that You will make them mute so they can no longer speak to me or anyone else. I ask all of this in Your name, Jesus.</p>

<p>Father, I also ask that You would surround me with as many angels as it takes to protect me, keep me safe, and out of harm’s way at all times. Help me to remember that every devil, demon, and demonic force is outside of Your Kingdom. Help me to remember that I am inside of Your Kingdom, protected and provided for by You personally. They have no power, no right, no authority to even speak to a Child of the Living God.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, remind me who I am. Remind me what’s true. Remind me that I am not fighting for victory — I’m fighting from victory. Jesus already won. The cross already crushed the darkness. The resurrection already sealed the outcome. So I will not retreat. I will not be afraid. I will stand firm, knowing You are fighting with me and for me.</p>

<p>I want what You want, God — not a comfortable life, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I learn to trust You in the fire. One where I see Your power even in the storm. One where I come out stronger, more rooted, and more surrendered than ever before.</p>

<p>Thank You for Your protection. Thank You for Your authority. Thank You for the victory that’s already mine in Jesus. I take refuge in You now — my fortress, my defender, my deliverer, and my peace.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
