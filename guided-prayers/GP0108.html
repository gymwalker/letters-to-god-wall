<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Afraid</h2>

<p>God, I’m afraid. I don’t want to admit it, but it’s true. My thoughts are spinning, my chest feels tight, and everything inside me is bracing for something bad. I can’t see what’s coming, and it’s hard to trust that You’re still in control when everything feels so uncertain.</p>

<p>I don’t want to live in fear, but right now, it feels like fear is living in me. I’m afraid of what might happen. I’m afraid of losing something — or someone — I love. I’m afraid that I won’t be strong enough if things get worse. And if I’m honest… I’m even afraid that You might not come through.</p>

<p>But here I am, God — not hiding, not pretending — just bringing it all to You. Because You said I could. You said “do not fear” not as a command to shame me, but as an invitation to trust You. So I’m taking You at Your word. I don’t have peace right now, but I’m asking You to bring it. I don’t feel brave, but I’m asking You to hold me while I find my footing again.</p>

<p>Help me to remember who You are. You are my refuge. My strong tower. My ever-present help in trouble. You are the same God who parted seas, who shut lions’ mouths, who calmed the storm with a word — and You haven’t changed. You are not intimidated by what scares me. You are not overwhelmed by what overwhelms me. You are God. And You are here.</p>

<p>Speak into the places where fear has a grip. Shine light into the corners where lies have grown. Fill the silence with Your truth. And when I can’t stop the fear on my own, let me rest in You instead of running from the unknown.</p>

<p>I may not know what’s ahead, but I know You’re with me in it. And if You’re here, then I’m not alone. So Father, help me to want what You want. To desire you more than my fears. To trade my fear for faith. To breathe deeper. To trust greater. And to follow You — even if I do it scared.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
