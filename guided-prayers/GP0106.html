<h2>A Prayer for When You Can’t Stop Crying</h2>

<p>God, the tears won’t stop. I don’t even know if I could explain why — all I know is that my heart feels overwhelmed, and the pain keeps leaking out through my eyes. I feel fragile, raw, exposed. The tears come in waves, and sometimes they hit when I least expect it. And I’m tired… so tired of crying.</p>

<p>I don’t know what to do with all of this. I’ve tried to hold it together. I’ve tried to stay strong. But right now, I just feel broken. I feel like I’ve lost control. And maybe, God… maybe that’s not the worst thing. Maybe this is the part where I stop pretending and start handing it all to You.</p>

<p>You see every tear. You keep count of them. You understand what they mean — even the ones I can’t explain. You are not annoyed by my weeping. You are not disappointed in my pain. You’re not asking me to pull myself together. You’re inviting me to come undone… safely, in Your arms.</p>

<p>God, I need You. I need You to sit with me in this flood of emotion. I need You to steady my breathing, calm my thoughts, and remind me that I’m not weak for feeling deeply. You designed my heart — and You’re not afraid of how much it hurts right now. In fact, You are close to the brokenhearted, and You save those crushed in spirit. So here I am — crushed, overwhelmed, feeling broken, and clinging to You.</p>

<p>Help me not to rush this moment, but to feel it with You. Help me not to shame myself for these tears. Help me to rest in the truth that You are near, You are loving, caring, and kind, and You are strong enough to carry both me and my sorrow.</p>

<p>And when the tears finally slow… remind me that You’re still with me. That Your love didn’t waver. That Your presence never left. That I am still Yours. Still held. Still seen. Still safe. Still loved!</p>

<p>Thank You for being the God who weeps with me. The God who hears the cries I don’t say out loud. The God who won’t let go — even when I’m falling apart.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
