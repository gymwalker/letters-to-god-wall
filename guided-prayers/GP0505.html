<h2>A Prayer of Praise for God’s Faithfulness</h2>

<p>God, You have been faithful. Over and over again, through every season, through every storm, through every joy and every sorrow — You have never failed me. Even when I didn’t understand, even when I couldn’t see it, even when I didn’t deserve it… You were still faithful. And You still are.</p>

<p>I praise You because Your faithfulness isn’t based on my performance. It isn’t earned or lost. It’s who You are. You cannot be unfaithful — because You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. When others have walked away, You stayed. When I doubted, You remained true. When I strayed, You called me back. When I was too weak to believe, You held me anyway.</p>

<p>Thank You for every prayer You’ve answered — and every one You’ve answered differently than I expected. Thank You for the doors You’ve opened and the ones You’ve closed. For the ways You’ve protected me, provided for me, and preserved me, even when I didn’t know it. Looking back, I see Your fingerprints all over my life — and I know You’ve never stopped working.</p>

<p>God, I want to build my life on the foundation of Your faithfulness. When I’m tempted to worry, help me to remember. When I feel afraid, remind me of Your track record. When I’m discouraged, lead me to testimonies — mine and others’ — that speak of Your trustworthiness. Help me to carry a heart of praise into every new day, because You are already in it. Because You’ve already been faithful, and You always will be.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just comfort or certainty, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where my faith is strengthened by remembering Your faithfulness. One where my praise isn’t rooted in what’s happening, but in who You’ve proven Yourself to be.</p>

<p>Thank You for being the God who keeps every promise. The One who finishes what He starts. The One who never lets go.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
