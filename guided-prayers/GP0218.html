<h2>A Prayer for Letting Go of the Past</h2>

<p>God, there are things I’m still holding onto — things I thought I let go of, things I thought I moved past, but they keep coming back. I'm dragging them around with me, and they are a heavy burden to me. The Scars. The Events. The pain. The regret. The memories. The words I can’t forget and the wounds I haven’t fully healed from. I play the victim. I blame everyone else, I even blame You. And I don’t want to carry them anymore.</p>

<p>I know I can’t change what happened. I know I can’t undo the choices I made or the ones that were made for me. But God, I need Your help to release their grip on me. To let the burden go, to put it down, to walk away from it. I need You to meet me in the places where the past still stings and show me how to live free — not just forgiven, but truly free.</p>

<p>Teach me how to grieve what needs to be grieved, not to hold onto it, not to play with it, not to mourn it, and not to stay stuck in sorrow. Teach me how to remember without reliving. How to learn without being defined by what I’ve walked through. I don’t want to be the person who keeps looking backward. I want to be someone who moves forward — with You. Help me to know and understand, the past is just that, IN THE PAST. Help me to learn from it, not dwell on it. Help me to live with You in the present. To keep an eye on the future, but not dwell on it. My focus should be the here and the now, right now, this minute, this second. That is what is important. Yesterday is gone. Help me to leave it there.</p>

<p>God, if there’s still unforgiveness in me, bring it into the light. If there’s still bitterness buried deep, pull it up by the roots. If there is anger still in me, help me to forgive and release it all to you. If I’ve built my identity around what I’ve survived instead of who You say I am, then break those false foundations. I want Your truth to define me — not my past.</p>

<p>Let Your healing go deep. Speak to the parts of me still frozen in those old chapters. Restore what was stolen. Redeem what was broken. And release me from anything that keeps me from living the life You’ve called me to now.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not a life of regret or replaying old pain, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. A life marked by Your mercy, shaped by Your grace, and anchored in Your presence.</p>

<p>Thank You for already forgiving what I still struggle to forget. Help me to move forward — not alone, but with You leading the way.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
