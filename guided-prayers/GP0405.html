<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Angry at God</h2>

<p>God, I don’t want to feel this way — but I do. I’m angry. Frustrated. Disappointed. You could have stopped this. You could have changed it. You could have spoken, acted, healed, intervened… and You didn’t. You could have protected me from it, but You didn't. And even though I know You’re still good, I’m having a hard time reconciling that goodness with what I’ve been through. With what You allowed.</p>

<p>I feel hurt by Your silence. Confused by Your timing. Wounded by what feels like absence. And while part of me wants to run from You, part of me also knows that You are still the only safe place to bring this pain. So I’m coming — I'm choosing You, not polished, not proud, but honest. I’m laying it all down at Your feet. The questions. The grief. The accusations I haven’t dared say out loud. You already know them anyway.</p>
  
<p>I forgive You Lord, not that You need forgiveness, but I need to forgive you. I need to let go, release the pain, anger, frustration I have built up in my heart against you for not helping my life go according to my plans. I know You have Your will, truly I do want to cooperate with Your will for my life, but I struggle with wanting what I want.</p>

<p>I am grateful that You’re not afraid of my anger. You’ve handled far worse from far better people. David yelled. Job protested. Jeremiah wept. Jesus Himself cried out, “My God, why have You forsaken Me?” You didn’t shame them for it. You stayed. So I trust You’ll stay with me, too — even in this.</p>

<p>Help me process this anger with You, not apart from You. Help me to pour it out in prayer, not pour it into bitterness. Show me what I don’t yet see. Heal what still hurts. Reveal if there’s something I’ve misunderstood — and teach me how to trust again, even when I don’t get the answers I want. Show me how to mourn what was lost while still clinging to what is true.</p>

<p>Bring people into my life who won’t minimize the pain or rush the healing. Lead me to scriptures that speak to the ache. Surround me with reminders of who You are — not just what You do. Rebuild the trust that’s cracked. Restore the closeness that anger has pushed away. And forgive me for my anger Lord!</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just resolution, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I love what You love just because You love it. One that’s strong enough to weather disappointment. One that doesn’t need to pretend. One that grows deeper even in the questions, even in the silence, even in the struggle.</p>

<p>Thank You for being patient with me. For not walking away. For loving me through this — even when I don’t feel like loving You back. I may be angry now, but I still believe You’re good. I still believe You’re here. And I still want You more than I want answers. Help me to let go of my anger and fall into Your love.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
