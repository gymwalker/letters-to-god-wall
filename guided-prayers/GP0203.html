<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Anxious</h2>

<p>God, my thoughts won’t slow down. My heart is racing, my chest feels tight, and I can’t stop running through every worst-case scenario. Anxiety has a grip on me — and I feel like I’m barely holding it together. I know I’m not supposed to worry. I know You tell me not to fear. But right now, that feels impossible.</p>

<p>So instead of hiding it, I bring it to You. Every anxious thought, every what-if, every fear that keeps me up at night. I lay it all at Your feet. You already see it anyway. You already know what I’m carrying. So here it is — raw, messy, and real.</p>

<p>You are not surprised by my anxiety. You’re not angry at my struggle. You are the God who meets me in the middle of the storm, not just when the skies are clear. And You’re not asking me to fix myself. You’re asking me to come closer — to draw near even when I feel afraid.</p>

<p>Help me to trust that You’re already in tomorrow. That I don’t have to have all the answers because You do. That I don’t have to be in control because You are. Help me to trust You in and through all of this. Remind me that You are my refuge — not just from trouble, but in the middle of it. That You are steady when everything around me feels unstable.</p>

<p>God, calm my body. Quiet my mind. Anchor my heart. Let Your peace — Your Shalom peace, you know, Your perfect peace, the peace that doesn’t even make sense — guard me. Wrap me up in it. Surround me with it. Let me feel it deep in my bones.</p>

<p>And if the anxiety doesn’t vanish right away, help me to keep choosing You. To breathe in Your presence. To fight back with truth. To lean into Your promises instead of my fears.</p>

<p>I trust that You’re bigger than what I’m facing. That You love me in the midst of this. And that You are enough for me — even here. Help me want what You want most of all — a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One that carries me through every anxious moment, into perfect peace.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
