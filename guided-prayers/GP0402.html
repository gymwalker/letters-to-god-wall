<h2>A Prayer for Spiritual Strength</h2>

<p>God, I’m tired, I'm weary, I'm exhausted — not just in body, but in soul. I’ve been fighting battles no one sees, carrying weights no one knows, and trying to stay strong when I feel like I’m barely hanging on. I know I’m not supposed to do this in my own strength… but I forget that sometimes. I try to be everything for everyone. I try to hold it all together. And I end up worn down, empty, and fragile. Which is where you find me today.</p>

<p>But You, God, are never tired. Never overwhelmed. Never shaken. Never worried. You don’t grow weary like I do. So today, I lay down my weakness, my exhaustion — and I reach for Your strength. Not just physical strength to make it through the day, but spiritual strength to stand firm in the storm. To resist temptation. To keep believing. To keep praying. To keep walking when I want to quit.</p>

<p>Strengthen my spirit, Lord. Not just so I can feel better, but so I can live the life You’ve called me to. Remind me of who I am — and whose I am. Remind me that I have access to everything I need for godliness and endurance because You live in me. Fill me with Your power, not just for survival, but for victory. Make me bold in faith. Rooted in truth. Steady in hope. Overflowing with grace.</p>

<p>Teach me how to feed my spirit — not my flesh. Lead me to Your Word and help me love it, absorb it, and live it. Give me wisdom to recognize the things that drain me and courage to say no to them. Help me identify the people, books, messages, and habits that will build me up spiritually — and draw me closer to You. Stir up a hunger in me to learn, to grow, and to go deeper with You every day.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not a weak, shallow faith, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I don’t just know about You, but walk with You. One where I don’t just survive the struggle, but come through it stronger because You carried me. One where my strength comes not from striving, but from surrender.</p>

<p>Thank You for being my source. My anchor. My power when I have none of my own. I receive Your strength today — not because I deserve it, but because You love me and promised it would be mine.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
