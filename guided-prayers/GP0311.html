<h2>A Prayer for When You Can’t Hear God</h2>

<p>God, I don’t know where You are right now. I’ve prayed. I’ve listened. I’ve waited. I've asked. I seek. I knock. But the silence is stretching longer than I expected, and I’m starting to wonder if I’ve done something wrong. If there is some sin preventing me from connecting with You, with hearing Your voice. I miss Your voice. I miss Your presence. I miss the way You used to speak so clearly. The way I could feel You near me.</p>

<p>I know You haven’t left me. I know You’re not ignoring me. But right now, it’s hard to feel that truth. My heart feels heavy, and doubt keeps trying to slip in. So I’m coming to You anyway—without the answers, without the clarity, without the feelings I want—because I still believe You’re here.</p>

<p>Help me remember that Your silence doesn’t mean absence. Remind me that You’re still speaking, even if it’s not the way I’m used to hearing You. Open my eyes to see You in the small things. Open my ears to hear the whispers I’ve been missing. Help me to be still—not just outwardly, but inwardly—so I can receive what You’re trying to give me in this quiet season.</p>

<p>If there’s something You want me to hear, make it clear. If there’s something I need to release, show me, and I will let it go. And if this silence is part of how You’re growing my faith, then give me the strength to lean in rather than pull away. I don’t want to run—I want to stay close, even when it’s hard.</p>

<p>I want what You want — a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. Even in the silence. Even in the unknown. I trust that You are still speaking, still guiding, still loving me completely.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
