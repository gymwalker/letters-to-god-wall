<h2>A Prayer for When You Want God’s Will</h2>

<p>God, I don’t want to chase what looks good or feels comfortable if it’s not what You want for me. I don’t want to waste my energy building something You never asked for. Deep down, I know that what You want is better—even if it’s harder, slower, or different than what I imagined. So help me let go of my grip and surrender my plans to You.</p>

<p>I’m tired of trying to figure everything out on my own. I need Your wisdom. I need Your guidance. I need Your strength to trust You when I can’t see the whole picture. If there’s something I’m holding on to that’s blocking Your will, show me. If there’s a door You’ve closed, help me stop pounding on it. And if You’ve opened one, give me the courage to walk through it—even if it leads into the unknown.</p>

<p>Align my heart with Yours. Not just my circumstances, but my desires. Shape the way I think, what I hope for, and how I pray. I don’t want to just ask You to bless my plans—I want my life to be part of *Your* plan. Help me to be patient when You say wait, humble when You say no, and bold when You say go.</p>

<p>Father, all of this requires me to Trust You. Not just to Trust You but to Trust Your will. Trusting You isn't always easy. It also requires me to surrender everything to You. And here's the part I forget sometimes. I can't LOVE You if I don't TRUST You. So, strenthen my trust when it is weak. Help me to surrender everything to You, total, absolute, complete, surrender. And grow and strenthen my Love for You in all the ways I need most.</p>

<p>God, I know You see things I can’t. You know what I need and who I’m becoming. You’re writing a story so much bigger than mine. So even when I’m afraid, even when I don’t understand, I choose to trust that Your will is good, Your timing is perfect, and Your love is unshakable.</p>

<p>I want what You want — a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. If that’s all I walk away with… it’s more than enough. Because in that kind of relationship, trust, surrender, and love have already been proven.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
