<h2>A Prayer for When You Feel Surrounded by Fear</h2>

<p>God, I feel surrounded. The fear is closing in from every side — fear of what might happen, fear of what won’t, fear of failing, fear of being hurt again, fear of never being free from this heaviness. Fear of not being good enough. My thoughts are racing. My chest is tight. My peace feels like it’s slipping away. I want to trust You, but fear is trying to drown out everything else.</p>

<p>I know fear is not from You. I know You haven’t given me a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind. But right now, it feels like fear is all I can hear — whispering lies, feeding my doubt, stealing my joy. I need You, God. Not just for comfort, but for courage. Not just to calm me down, but to build me up in truth so I can fight back.</p>

<p>Help me remember what’s true. You are with me. You go before me. You are my refuge and my strength. You are the One who surrounds what surrounds me. You command angels concerning me. You silence storms with a word. You walk on the very waves that threaten to take me under. Nothing — absolutely nothing — is bigger than You.</p>

<p>So right now, I choose to call on Your name. I choose to worship, even in the fear. I choose to speak truth out loud — that You are my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? That You are for me, not against me. That You are fighting for me, even when I feel overwhelmed. I choose to let Your Word be louder than the fear in my head.</p>

<p>Lead me to Scriptures that anchor me. Fill my space with worship that lifts my eyes. Bring people who remind me I’m not alone. Teach me to take every fearful thought captive and make it obedient to Christ. Help me to continue to consume Your truth. Help me to stand in faith — even when I feel afraid — because courage isn’t the absence of fear, it’s choosing You in the middle of it.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just temporary relief, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where Your perfect love casts out every fear. One where I live grounded in truth, not gripped by lies. One where I learn to face the storm, not because I’m brave, but because I’m Yours.</p>

<p>Thank You for being bigger than my fear. Thank You for walking with me through every shadow, every night, every unknown. I trust You, God — even when I’m surrounded. Because You are here… and You are good, and that changes everything.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
