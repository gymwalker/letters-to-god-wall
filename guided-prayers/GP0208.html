<h2>A Prayer for When You’ve Fallen Again</h2>

<p>God, I did it again. I told myself I wouldn’t. I promised I’d do better. And yet… here I am, sitting in the aftermath of another failure. I feel ashamed. Frustrated. Defeated. Worried that if I continue, You may just give up on me. I hate feeling like this. I don’t even want to look at You right now — not because I don’t love You, but because I feel ashamed, like I’ve let You down. Again.</p>

<p>I know You saw it coming. I know You’re not surprised. But I still hate how familiar this place feels — this cycle of messing up and trying to crawl my way back. Sometimes I wonder if You’re tired of hearing me apologize. Tired of my broken promises. Tired of me.</p>

<p>But deep down, I know the truth — You don’t love me because I get it right. You love me because You are love. Because You chose me. Which means, Your love for me is not based on a feeling or the way you feel about me today. It's not based on what I do or don't do. But rather, it is a firm, concrete, unchanable choice you made to love me before the foundations of the Earth. There is nothing, absolutely nothing I could do, including all these failures, that would ever, that could ever, cause you to un-love me. Please, Father, help that to sink into my very soul. Help it to encourage me to "Choose" You as well, and to dedicate my life to Loving YOU. Truly because you "Chose" to love me first! In addition, help me to know that Your mercy is bigger than my mistakes. And even now, even here, You haven’t walked away.</p>

<p>So I come again — not with excuses, but with honesty. Not with perfection, but with repentance. I confess my sin, my weakness, my inconsistency. Father, I am truly sorry. And I ask for Your forgiveness. For Your cleansing. For Your healing. Not just to throw my sin away as far as the East is from the West. Not just to wipe away the guilt, but to transform the broken places in me that keep running back to the same old thing.</p>

<p>Help me, God. Help me break this pattern. Help me stop pretending I’m stronger than I am. Help me to invite You into the moments of temptation — not just the moments of regret. Strengthen my spirit. Renew my mind. And teach me how to walk in freedom, one step at a time, even when I stumble.</p>

<p>Surround me with people who will speak truth, walk with me, and remind me of who I am in You. Help me to stop listening to my flesh. Help me to silence the voice of shame and listen to the voice of Your Spirit — the voice that calls me redeemed, chosen, and still deeply loved.</p>

<p>I want what You want, Lord — not just behavior change, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. A relationship that doesn’t break when I fall, but grows stronger every time I come back to You.</p>

<p>Thank You for being the God who still wants me, even when I fall. I choose to rise again — with You. Thank you Father for the hand up. Thank you for always loving me.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
