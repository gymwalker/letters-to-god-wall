<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Exhausted</h2>

<p>God, I’m tired, so tired — not just physically, but deep down in my soul. I’m drained in ways I don’t know how to describe. I feel like I’m running on empty, trying to hold everything together, but I can feel the cracks. I’m worn out from trying to be strong, to keep up, to stay hopeful, to carry burdens I was never meant to carry alone.</p>

<p>I come to You now, not with eloquent words or polished prayers, but with a weary heart that just needs rest. You said, “Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” So here I am. Weary. Burdened. Needing You. Needing the rest You promised.</p>

<p>God, I don’t just need a nap or a break. I need Your strength. I need Your peace. I need Your presence to settle the restlessness inside of me. I need to breathe again — deeply, calmly, freely — knowing that I am safe with You.</p>

<p>Remind me, Lord, that I don’t have to earn Your approval. That I don’t have to have it all figured out. That it's okay to need help. That it’s okay to collapse into Your arms. You are not disappointed by my weakness — You are compassionate toward it. You understand exhaustion. You’ve felt it too. And You’ve promised to carry me through it.</p>

<p>Give me permission, Father, to slow down. To let go. To say no. To rest. Remind me that resting in You isn’t lazy — it’s obedient. It's holy. It’s necessary. Help me to release the lies that say I’m only valuable when I’m productive, or only loved when I’m performing.</p>

<p>Hold me here, Jesus. Let Your gentleness quiet my fears and Your mercy meet me in my limits. Thank You for being the God who never grows tired, who never sleeps — so I don’t have to be everything for everyone.</p>

<p>Help me to want what You want — a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. Even in my exhaustion, let that desire anchor my heart. Let that relationship refuel my soul.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
