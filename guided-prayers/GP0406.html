<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Weary from the Fight</h2>

<p>God, I’m tired. So tired. Weary and exhausted. Not just from lack of sleep or a busy schedule, but from the weight of this battle. I’ve been praying. Believing. Standing. Hoping. And still… the fight goes on. The breakthrough hasn’t come. The answers feel far away. The weariness is settling deep in my bones, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this. Father, why am I so weary? Am I fighting in my own strength? Am I not resting in You? Am I not giving this to You? Why am I losing hope?</p>

<p>I know You see me. I know You haven’t forgotten. I know You’re still working. But right now, I feel worn down — overwhelmed, like the fight is slowly draining every ounce of life out of me. I’m not looking for comfort in the world, Lord. I want it from You. I need Your strength to carry me. I need Your presence to restore me. I need You to breathe life back into these dry, battle-worn places of my soul. I need You to be my hope and my strength when I am weary!</p>

<p>You said, “Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” I’m coming. Not with energy. Not with answers. Just with a heart that needs rest — and a soul that needs You. I’m laying down my sword, not in surrender to the enemy, but in surrender to You. Because the battle is not mine… it’s Yours.</p>

<p>Remind me that You are still fighting for me — even when I don’t feel strong. Remind me that the enemy is already defeated — even when I feel surrounded. Teach me to rest without giving up. To worship while I wait. To trust even when I’m trembling. Lead me to Scriptures, songs, and people who will speak truth to my tired heart. Show me how to recover, how to breathe, how to simply be held by You.</p>

<p>God, I want what You want — not just relief from the struggle, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I find rest, not because the fight is over, but because You’re in it with me. One where I don’t have to be strong all the time, because Your strength is enough for both of us.</p>

<p>Thank You for never growing weary. Thank You for never leaving me to fight alone. Thank You for loving me through every high and every low. I place my weariness in Your hands today — and I trust You to carry me forward.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
