<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Doubting</h2>

<p>God, I want to believe. I’ve believed before. I’ve known Your presence. I’ve seen You work. But right now, everything feels uncertain. My heart feels fragile, my faith feels thin, and doubt is knocking louder than ever. I still talk to You, but it feels like I’m talking through glass — like You’re far away or silent. And sometimes I wonder… are You really there?</p>

<p>I don’t want to live in this tension, this insecurity of not knowing. However, I know You’re not afraid of it. You’re not ashamed of my questions or disappointed by my wrestling. You’re not turning away from me because I’m struggling to hold on. In fact, I believe You’re drawing closer. So instead of hiding this doubt, I bring it into the light — raw, vulnerable, and real.</p>

<p>Help me remember that even those who walked beside You — Peter, Thomas, John the Baptist — they wrestled too. They doubted, they questioned, and You didn’t cast them aside. You met them in their confusion. You answered with compassion. You stayed. So I’m asking You to stay with me now. Meet me in the fog. Speak to the lies. Steady what’s shaking. And strengthen what remains.</p>

<p>I don’t want to build my faith on emotions, feelings, or circumstances. I want it rooted in You — in truth that doesn’t shift when life does. I want to believe even when I can’t see. To worship even when I don’t feel. To trust even when I don’t understand. Give me glimpses, Lord — little moments that remind me You’re still here. That You haven’t left. That You still love me.</p>

<p>Surround me with voices that speak truth into my very soul. Help me to research and find resources that will help answer my questions and minimize my doubts. Help me to see, know, and embrace all of the evidence you've placed there for us to discover. Silence the lies and the voices that feed my fear. Ecourage me to fill my mind with Your Word, Your truth. Lead me to testimonies that build my faith. And help me to keep walking — even with trembling steps — toward You. I know You’re not waiting for me to be perfect. You’re just asking me to come.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just answers, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One that grows even through the doubt. One that can handle the questions. One that comes out stronger on the other side. I don’t want to fake it — I want to find You here, in the real, in the wrestling, in the raw.</p>

<p>Thank You for being patient with me. Thank You for not letting go. Thank You for loving me through this valley. I believe… help my unbelief.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
