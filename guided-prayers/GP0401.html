<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Doubting</h2>

<p>God, I want to believe. But right now, my heart is full of questions. I’ve said the words, sung the songs, prayed the prayers—but today, I feel distant. Disconnected. Unsure. The faith I used to hold with confidence now feels shaky in my hands. I know You’re real, but I struggle to feel You. I know You’re good, but I wrestle to see how that goodness applies to me. And sometimes, I wonder if You’re really listening at all.</p>

<p>I’m not proud of my doubt. But I also know You’re not afraid of it. So instead of pretending it’s not there, I’m bringing it to You. I don’t want to run or hide—I want to understand. To grow. To return to the place where my heart feels anchored again in truth. Would You meet me in this place of uncertainty? Would You show me that I don’t have to have it all figured out to be fully loved by You?</p>

<p>Jesus, even Your disciples doubted. Even those who walked beside You had moments of confusion and fear. And You didn’t shame them—you drew closer. So I’m asking You to draw close to me now. Speak truth into the lies I’ve believed. Show me what’s real. Strengthen the parts of my heart that are weak. And give me courage to keep seeking You, even when I feel unsure. Encourage me and help me to find the right resources that will speak truth into my doubts. Help me to see and embrace the evidence that already defends you. Help me to fill my mind, my heart with Your truth. With Your love.</p>

<p>God, I don’t want to build my faith on feelings or emotions—I want it rooted in You. In who You are, not just what I see. So help me hold on. Remind me of Your promises. Give me small glimpses of Your faithfulness that I can cling to when the fog of doubt feels thick. And even when I can’t feel You, help me remember that You’ve never left.</p>

<p>I know that doubt isn’t the end—it’s part of the journey. So I’m not giving up. I’m pressing in. I’m choosing to lean into Your grace, one moment at a time, even if my faith feels fragile. Because even faith the size of a mustard seed is enough in Your hands.</p>

<p>I want what You want—a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You that stands firm through every storm, every doubt, every question. Strengthen my faith, Lord. I believe… help my unbelief.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
