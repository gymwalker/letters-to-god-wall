<h3>A Prayer for Letting Go of What You Can’t Undo</h3>

<p>God, there are things I wish I could take back. Words I said. Choices I made. People I hurt. Moments I’ll never get a second chance at. And no matter how much time passes, the weight of regret still lingers. I replay the scenes in my head, wishing I could rewrite the story — but I can’t. What’s done is done. And that truth aches.</p>

<p>I know You’ve forgiven me. I’ve heard the truth. I’ve read the verses. But sometimes, my heart still hasn’t caught up to what my head knows. I struggle to receive that kind of mercy — the kind that covers even this. The kind that doesn’t require me to earn my way back, but invites me to be loved right here, in the middle of the mess I made.</p>

<p>God, I need You to help me let go of what I can’t change. I need You to teach me how to live forgiven — not just in theory, but in practice. I’ve been living like I still owe a debt You already paid. I’ve been walking in shame You already buried. I’ve been defining myself by a chapter You’ve already redeemed. Help me stop that. Help me to truly live in Your freedom.</p>

<p>Teach me how to forgive myself, Lord. Teach me how to let go and let You be in control of my life. Show me how to grieve without getting stuck. Show me how to own what’s mine — and release what’s not. Show me how to walk forward without dragging chains You already broke.</p>

<p>And where there are consequences I still have to face, walk with me through them. Give me courage to do what’s right now, even if I didn’t before. And when the enemy tries to whisper that I’m disqualified, remind me that You’ve already said otherwise. That You still have a purpose for me — even now. Especially now.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not a life trapped in regret, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where my past doesn’t define me, because Your grace does.</p>

<p>Thank You for loving me too much to leave me stuck in what I can’t undo. Thank You for the cross that covered even this. I choose to walk in that freedom now.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
