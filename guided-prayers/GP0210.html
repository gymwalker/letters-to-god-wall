<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Ready to Start Over with God</h2>

<p>God, I’m ready. I don’t have all the answers. I still feel scared. I don’t even know where this road will take me — but I know I can’t stay where I’ve been. I’ve come to the end of myself, and I want something new. I want something real. I want You first before anything else. I want you to be enough for me.</p>

<p>Thank You for not giving up on me. Thank You for being patient through my wandering, my rebellion, my numbness, my fear. Forgive me for putting others and other things before You and my relationship with You. I see now that even when I was running from You, You were still chasing after me. You never stopped loving me — not for a second. And now… I’m done running. I’m coming home.</p>

<p>I don’t want to rebuild my life on the same broken foundation. I want You to rebuild it — Your way, in Your time, by Your Spirit. Tear down whatever needs to go. Heal what’s been wounded, broken. Restore what’s been lost. Lead me, Lord, one step at a time. I’m Yours.</p>

<p>God, I know starting over doesn’t mean starting from scratch. You’re not erasing my past — You’re redeeming it and transforming me in the process. You’re using every mistake, every heartbreak, every lesson to shape me into someone more like Jesus. Someone who is always loving, caring, kind, just like Jesus. So I won’t be afraid of beginning again. Not with You.</p>

<p>Show me where to go from here. Teach me how to live differently — with wisdom, with courage, with humility, and with hope. Help me choose to forgive myself. Help me choose to release the weight of regret. Help me choose to step forward in freedom, knowing that Your mercy is new every morning… and this is a new day.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just a fresh start, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I don’t just believe in You, but actually walk with You. Love You. Trust You. Obey You. Day by day. Step by step. All the way home.</p>

<p>Thank You for giving me this new beginning. Thank You for never letting go. Thank you for always loving me regardless of the mess I've made of my life.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
