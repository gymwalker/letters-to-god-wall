<h2>A Prayer for Breaking Addiction</h2>

<p>God, I feel trapped. I’ve tried to stop. I’ve made promises. I’ve felt shame. I’ve cried in secret. I know You've seen it all. But the grip of this addiction keeps pulling me back. My flesh is ruling over Your Spirit that lives inside of me. And I hate it — the cycle, the control, the lies I’ve told, the parts of myself I don’t even recognize anymore. I'm in bondage to this, I need the freedom that only You can provide. I feel stuck in something bigger than me… and I need You.</p>

<p>I can’t break this on my own. I’ve tried — You know I’ve tried. But willpower isn’t enough. My flesh doesn't care about me, it encourages me to give in, then shames me when I do. Self-help isn’t enough. I need deliverance. I need healing. I need Your power to set me free — not just from the behavior, but from the root of the pain that keeps driving me back to it.</p>

<p>God, truly, I want freedom more than I want temporary relief. I want wholeness more than I want escape. I want truth more than I want the numbness of this addiction. So I’m surrendering it to You — all of it. I'm laying it at Your feet. The cravings, the habits, the secrecy, the lies, the shame, the fear of who I’ll be without it. I give it to You. Take it, I don't want this anymore.</p>

<p>Show me what I’m really searching for. Fill the emptiness I’ve been trying to soothe. Speak to the hurt I’ve been trying to silence. Rewrite the lies I’ve believed about myself and about You. I need more than behavior change — I need heart transformation. I need You to take over the places I’ve let this addiction control.</p>

<p>Give me courage to reach out for help. Bring people into my life who will fight with me, not shame me. Give me wisdom to recognize the triggers. Strength to walk away. Grace to get back up when I fall. And most of all, keep reminding me — I am not alone. You are not ashamed of me. You are not done with me. You are not afraid of walking this battle with me.</p>

<p>Jesus, You came to set captives free. So I’m asking You to do that in me. Little by little. Moment by moment. Day by day. And even if it’s messy and slow and hard, I choose to keep coming back to You — because You are my only hope for lasting freedom. So Jesus, help me to feed Your Spirit that lives in me more than I feed the flesh that wants to keep me in bondage.</p>

<p>Help me want what You want, Lord — not just sobriety, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. Let that desire be stronger than my addiction. Stronger than my shame. Stronger than my fear. Stronger than the lies I tell myself. Let that relationship be what holds me — and frees me — for good.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
