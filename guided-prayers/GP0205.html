<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Burned Out</h2>

<p>God, I’m running on empty. I’ve pushed, I’ve poured out, I’ve tried to stay strong — but now I’m just exhausted. My soul feels scorched and dry, like I’ve got nothing left to give. I’m worn down by the weight of everything I’ve been carrying, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep going like this.</p>

<p>I thought I was doing the right thing — being responsible, being strong, showing up — but somewhere along the way, I forgot to rest. I forgot to breathe. I forgot that You never asked me to do it all on my own. I forgot to focus on You, and I'm so sorry for that.</p>

<p>God, I need You to meet me here. In the fatigue. In the fog. In the numbness. Remind me that rest isn’t weakness — it’s obedience. Help me to let go of the lie that everything depends on me, and return to the truth that I am not the source — You are.</p>

<p>Fill what’s empty. Heal what’s wounded. Restore what’s broken. Reignite what’s gone dim inside of me. Teach me how to abide in You again. Not hustle. Not strive. Just abide — rest, trust, remain, in You.</p>

<p>Show me what boundaries I need to set, what burdens I need to release, and what rhythms I need to rebuild. And help me find joy again — not in doing, but in being Yours. Loved. Held. Known. Safe.</p>

<p>I don’t want to burn out and miss the beauty You’ve placed around me. I don’t want to live in survival mode when You’ve invited me into abundant life. Help me to choose differently — to choose You. To rest in You. To be restored by You.</p>

<p>Thank You, Jesus, for understanding what it feels like to be poured out. For withdrawing to quiet places. For reminding me that even You needed rest. I give You my weariness now. And I receive Your peace, Your Shalom Peace, Your perfect peace.</p>

<p>I want what You want, Lord. A strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. Not just when I’m full, but especially when I’m empty. Fill me again with You. Encourage me to continue to invest in my relationship with You, to not take You for granted anymore, to fall more in love with You each and every day.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
