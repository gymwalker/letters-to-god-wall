<h2>A Prayer of Worship for God's Holiness</h2>

<p>God, You are holy — completely set apart, totally pure, utterly perfect in every way. There is no one like You, no one beside You, no one even close. You are flawless in justice, unmatched in power, unshakable in righteousness, and unsearchable in Your wisdom. Angels cry “Holy, holy, holy” before Your throne — and I join them now, not just with words, but with awe in my heart.</p>

<p>In a world filled with compromise and confusion, Your holiness is a lighthouse. You are not swayed by culture, not changed by opinion, not tainted by sin. You are above it all — yet You reach down in mercy to meet me where I am. And that humbles me. That silences me. That draws me to worship You, not out of duty, but out of wonder. You are holy, and yet You love someone like me. That truth undoes me in the best possible way.</p>

<p>God, let Your holiness shape the way I live. Purify my heart. Cleanse my thoughts. Convict me gently when I stray. Help me to take sin seriously — not out of shame, but out of reverence for who You are. You are not casual, and I don’t want to treat You casually. Teach me to honor You with my life, to shine Your light into this dark world, to reflect Your character in how I love, how I speak, how I serve, and how I surrender.</p>

<p>Lead me into deeper worship — not just in music or words, but in every part of my soul and being. Let me tremble at Your majesty, bow before Your greatness, and rise changed by Your presence. Make me holy as You are holy — set apart, not because I’m better, but because You’ve called me Yours. Simply a Child of the Living God!</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just an emotional moment or religious routine, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where worship flows from reverence. One where awe turns into obedience. One where my life becomes a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to You.</p>

<p>Thank You for being holy — and for making a way for me to stand in Your presence through Jesus. I worship You now, not because I understand it all, but because You are worthy of it all.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
