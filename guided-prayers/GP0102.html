<h2>A Prayer for When Trauma Still Hurts</h2>

<p>God, I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t choose the pain I carry — it chose me. And even though time has passed, the wounds are still there, just beneath the surface. Sometimes they catch me off guard. Sometimes they keep me awake at night. Sometimes they whisper lies I don’t want to believe. This trauma still hurts… and I need You now more than ever.</p>

<p>There are days I wonder if I’ll ever be free. The past feels like a shadow I can’t outrun. The memories, the emotions, the brokenness — they cling to me in ways I don’t always understand. But You do. You see every scar. You know every tear. You were there when it happened, and You are here with me now. You never left me — even when I felt alone.</p>

<p>So I bring my trauma to You again, Lord — not because it’s easy, but because I can’t carry this weight without You. I don’t have the strength to forgive, but You do. I don’t know how to heal, but You do. I don’t want to fake it anymore. I want to be whole. I want to live free. I want to trust that the pain doesn’t have the final word — You do.</p>

<p>Help me to forgive those who hurt me — not because they deserve it, but because You call me to freedom. I can’t do that without You. Give me Your strength to do the impossible. Heal the places in me I’ve hidden or shut down. Breathe Your life into the dark corners. Let Your love speak louder than the pain.</p>

<p>God, I don’t want to be defined by my trauma — I want to be defined by Your grace. So I choose to invite You in. Even if it takes time. Even if it hurts. Even if it means opening up places I’ve tried to bury. Walk with me, Jesus. Sit with me in the silence. Hold me when I’m afraid. Speak truth when I forget who I am. Rebuild what’s been broken.</p>

<p>And when the pain resurfaces — because it might — remind me again that I am not alone. That You are still healing me. That Your peace is still real. That Your love is still deeper than what I’ve been through. And that I have forgiven them and I do not have to carry this pain anymore, it is no longer mine to carry. I release it all to you.</p>

<p>I believe You can redeem this pain. I believe You can make all things new — even this. And I believe You’re not done with me yet. I trust You, Jesus. Even in this.</p>

<p>In Your name, Amen.</p>
