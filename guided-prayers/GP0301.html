<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Seeking</h2>

<p>God, I’m searching. I’m reaching out for answers, for clarity, for direction. I don’t want to take another step without You. I need to know You’re in this, that You’re guiding me, that I’m not walking blind. That I'm not walking alone. That your promise to never leave me, to never forsake me is true?</p>

<p>You promised that when we ask, when we seek, when we knock, with all our hearts, we’ll find You. So here I am, heart wide open, asking, seeking, knocking, desiring You to meet me here. Speak into my uncertainty. Illuminate what’s hidden. Help me to recognize Your voice above all the noise.</p>

<p>I confess that sometimes I chase after solutions more than I seek Your presence. Forgive me, Lord. Refocus my heart. Don’t let me settle for answers when what I truly need is You.</p>

<p>Open the right doors and close the wrong ones—even if I don’t understand why. Give me peace that passes understanding and the courage to wait when You say wait and to move when You say move.</p>

<p>God, I’m seeking—not just for a solution, but for a deeper connection with You. Let this season of searching draw me closer to Your heart. Use this time to refine me, teach me, and lead me into the fullness of what You’ve prepared.</p>

<p>Thank You for never hiding Yourself from me. Thank You for being a God who wants to be found. I believe You will lead me exactly where I need to be—because You are good, and You are faithful. So, help me to trust in You!</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
