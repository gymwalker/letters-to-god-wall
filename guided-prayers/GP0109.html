<h2>A Prayer for When You Feel Forgotten</h2>

<p>God, I don’t want to feel this way… but I do. I feel forgotten. Overlooked. Left behind. I see You showing up for others — answering prayers, opening doors, sending comfort — but when I look at my own life, I feel like You’ve gone silent. Like maybe You’ve moved on… or maybe I was never on Your radar to begin with.</p>

<p>I know that’s not what Your Word says. I know You promise to never leave me, to never forsake me, to never forget me. But right now, it’s hard to feel those promises. Right now, it feels like I’m shouting into the void — and all I hear is silence.</p>

<p>I miss You, God. I miss the nearness, the clarity, the comfort. I miss feeling like You were walking beside me. I know You’re still here… but I need help believing it again. I need help holding on when it feels like I’ve been left behind.</p>

<p>So I bring You my doubt. My loneliness. My disappointment. My questions. I bring it all — not because I think You’ve forgotten me, but because I need You to remind me that You haven’t.</p>

<p>Speak to the parts of me that feel invisible. Whisper to the places that ache for acknowledgment. Reassure my soul that You still see me. That You still love me. That You are still working — even in the waiting, even in the silence, even when nothing around me looks like progress.</p>

<p>Help me to trust that I’m not behind. That I’m not too late. That I haven’t missed my moment. That what You’ve promised You will fulfill — in Your time, not mine. Give me the strength to keep showing up, even when it feels like no one sees. Because You do. And that’s enough.</p>

<p>Help me to want what You want. To chase intimacy with You more than answers from You. To rest in the truth that I’m held, even when I don’t feel it. And to believe again… that I have never been, and will never be, forgotten by You.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
