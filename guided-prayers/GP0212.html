<h2>A Prayer to Resist Pornography</h2>

<p>God, this battle feels relentless. The temptation, the pull, the shame — it all comes in waves. I’ve tried to fight it. I’ve promised myself I’d stop. But when I’m tired, lonely, stressed, or numb, it calls to me again. And sometimes — no, most of the time — I answer. I give in. Not because I want to hurt You, but because I forget who I am in You. My actions say it loud and clear: I love me more than I love You. I choose my needs over Yours. Forgive me, Lord. I don’t want to be like that. But this flesh of mine is so powerful. I am in bondage to this sinful behavior, and I need — no, I desire — Your freedom. Please, Lord, hear my cry and set me free.</p>

<p>Jesus, I need Your strength. I need Your truth to be louder than the lies. Louder than the cravings. Louder than the escape. Pornography promises comfort but leaves me empty. It whispers connection but delivers isolation. And I’m tired of letting it steal from me — my joy, my peace, my purity, my intimacy with You. It is so true: sin, all sin, interferes with my relationship with You. Father, forgive me. Wash me again. Renew me. Cleanse me. If it’s true that we become what we feed our minds, then this is not what I want for myself. Let me feed my mind with the good stuff — Your Word, Your truth, Your love.</p>

<p>So I bring this struggle to You. Not hiding. Not excusing. Not justifying. Just honesty. Because I know You’re not ashamed of me, even though I’m ashamed of myself. You’re fighting for me. You’re not here to condemn me, but to free me. And You already paid the price for my freedom. I want to live in that freedom now.</p>

<p>God, help me recognize the triggers. Help me choose a better path in the moment of temptation — to read Your Word, to put on praise and worship music, to go for a walk, to distract myself in ways that lead me back to You. Give me the courage to turn off the screen, walk away, reach out, pray — whatever it takes. Surround me with people who will fight for my heart, not just scold my behavior. I don’t just want to stop sinning — I want to start living differently. Fully. Freely. With You.</p>

<p>Heal the deeper wounds this addiction tries to cover. Fill the emptiness I’ve been medicating. Teach me how to be vulnerable in healthy ways. Teach me how to pursue real intimacy — with You, with others, with myself — instead of counterfeit connection.</p>

<p>And when I fall, help me run back to You — not away. Help me remember that my identity is not “addict” or “failure” or “too far gone.” My identity is child of the Living God. Forgiven. Free. And deeply, deeply loved.</p>

<p>I want what You want, God — not just behavior change, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I walk in purity, not just out of fear, but out of love — love for You, love for others, and love for the person You created me to be.</p>

<p>Thank You for never giving up on me. Thank You for seeing beyond this struggle. Thank You for giving me a way out, even now.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
