<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Battling Shame</h2>

<p>God, I feel so unworthy. I’ve messed up. I’ve done things I’m not proud of. And even though I know You forgive, shame still clings to me like a second skin. It whispers that I’m not enough. That I’ll never change. That if people really knew me — if You really knew me — I’d be rejected.</p>

<p>I try to hide it. I try to move on. But it always finds a way to follow me. I smile on the outside and carry the weight on the inside. It keeps me distant from others… and sometimes, from You. Because part of me still believes I have to be clean to come close. But that’s not what You say, is it?</p>

<p>You say I’m loved. You say I’m forgiven. You say I’m made new. You see everything — and You stay. So today, I bring You my shame. I lay it down. I stop pretending. I stop performing. I stop hiding. And I let You see it all. Because I trust that Your grace is stronger than my guilt.</p>

<p>God, silence the voice of the accuser. Shut down the lies that try to define me by my past. Remind me that shame is not from You — and that You don’t just forgive my sin, You cover my shame. You clothe me in righteousness. You call me son. You call me daughter. You call me Yours.</p>

<p>Help me to see myself the way You do. Not as damaged, but redeemed. Not as dirty, but cleansed. Not as worthless, but chosen. Let Your truth be louder than the lies that bombard me. Let Your love speak louder than my shame and regret.</p>

<p>God, I don’t want to live under shame anymore. I want freedom. I want joy. I want peace. I want You. Help me to want what You want — a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where shame no longer has a voice, because Your love has the final word.</p>

<p>Thank You for loving me right here. For walking me out of the shadows. For replacing shame with grace.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
