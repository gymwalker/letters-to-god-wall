<h2>A Prayer of Praise for God’s Sovereignty</h2>

<p>God, You are sovereign. Above it all. In control. Unshaken. Unmoved. There is no chaos You can’t calm, no enemy You can’t defeat, no detail You overlook. Nothing surprises You, nothing confuses You, and nothing is beyond Your reach. You see the end from the beginning. You know what I don’t. And even when I can’t trace Your hand, I trust Your heart — because You are God, and You are good.</p>

<p>I praise You for the way You rule with both power and compassion. For how You hold the universe together — and still hold my heart with care. You are not distant or disinterested. You are intimately involved in every moment of my life. Nothing happens without passing through Your hands first. Nothing escapes Your notice. No battle is too big for You, and no struggle is too small for You to care about.</p>

<p>When life feels out of control, I praise You for still being on the throne. When plans fall apart, I praise You for still having a plan. When I don’t understand, I praise You for understanding it all. And when fear tries to take over, I praise You for being the God who commands peace — and brings order out of the chaos.</p>

<p>Help me to live surrendered to Your will — not fighting for control, but following with trust. Teach me to rest in Your sovereignty, not resist it. Show me how to praise You not just when I like the outcome, but because I trust the One who holds the outcome. Remind me that even when life feels uncertain, You are not. Your sovereignty is steady. Secure. Unchanging.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just reassurance, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I learn to trust You fully. One where I find peace in Your plan, even when it doesn’t look like mine. One where surrender becomes worship, and trust becomes my daily posture.</p>

<p>Thank You for being the God who reigns over everything — and still chooses to walk with me through it all.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
