<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Confused</h2>

<p>God, I don’t understand what’s going on. I’ve prayed, I’ve waited, I’ve tried to stay faithful—but confusion keeps creeping in. My thoughts feel tangled, and my heart is weary from trying to make sense of it all. I don’t want to rely on my own understanding. I want to trust You. But right now, everything feels uncertain and unclear. On top of all that, I know You are not a God of confusion, our enemy is. So, this is not coming from You.</p>

<p>Since You are not the author of confusion, but of peace, I come to You asking for that peace to settle over me now. Even if I don’t get the answers I’m looking for, help me find rest in Your presence. Help me remember that You are not distant or silent—you are near, and You care deeply about what I’m walking through.</p>

<p>Show me what I need to see, Lord. If there’s something I’m missing, reveal it in Your timing. If I’m not meant to understand it yet, give me the grace to wait without falling into fear. Silence the lies that try to fill the gaps with doubt. Let Your truth be louder than my confusion.</p>

<p>God, You are my Shepherd—and Your Word says that Your sheep know and hear Your voice. So I choose to believe that even in the fog, You’re guiding me. Even in the chaos, You are steady. Even in the silence, You are speaking in ways I don’t yet recognize.</p>

<p>Give me the humility to ask for help when I need it, the discernment to know Your direction, and the courage to move forward when You lead. More than answers, Father, I want what You want—a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. I surrender the pressure to figure it all out, and instead I place my trust in You—the One who sees the whole picture and walks with me through every piece of it.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
