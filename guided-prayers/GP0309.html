<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Struggling with Your Identity</h2>

<p>God, I’m tired of trying to figure out who I am based on other people’s opinions, my past mistakes, or what the world says I should be. I’ve worn so many labels, and chased so many versions of myself, that I’ve lost sight of what’s real. Somewhere along the way, I forgot who I am—and even worse, who I am to You.</p>

<p>Some days I feel like I’m too much. Other days, not enough. I compare myself. I judge myself. I doubt myself. I get stuck trying to earn love or prove my worth. And all of it leaves me feeling more empty and confused. I need You to remind me of what’s true. Not just in my head—but in my heart, where it actually shapes how I live.</p>

<p>You say I am loved, chosen, forgiven, redeemed, created on purpose and for a purpose, adopted as your beloved son or daughter. You say I am Yours. All of this means that I am a prince or princess of the most High God. A child of the Living God! Help me believe that. Help me live like that. Help that truth to sink deep down into my very soul. Protect that truth and let nothing change it. Remove the lies I’ve believed for too long. Break the power of shame, rejection, and insecurity. I don’t want to build my identity on shifting sand—I want to build it on You. I want to build who I am on Your truth and only Your truth.</p>

<p>Jesus, You didn’t die so I could live in confusion. You came to restore what was broken—including how I see myself. So open my eyes. Pour Your Truth into me. Show me who I am in You—not in my performance, not in my appearance, not in my reputation—but in Your love alone. Root my confidence in Your truth.</p>

<p>I truly want what You want — a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. From that place, help me rediscover who I am: a child of the Living God, created in Your image, called by name, and known completely by You.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
