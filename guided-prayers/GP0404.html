<h2>A Prayer to Stand Firm in the Battle</h2>

<p>God, this battle feels real — not just around me, but inside me. I’m feeling the pressure, the pull, the weight of the fight. Some days it’s temptation. Other days, it’s fear, discouragement, or weariness. And sometimes… it’s all of it at once. I want to stand strong. I want to be faithful. But I’m tired, Lord. I need Your help to keep standing.</p>

<p>You’ve told me this isn’t just a physical battle — it’s spiritual. And I know the enemy would love nothing more than for me to give up, to cave in, to believe the lies instead of Your truth. But I refuse to fight this in my flesh. I choose to fight with what You’ve given me: the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit — Your Word. Help me to also use other weapons you've given me, the power of prayer, the power of the praise and worship of You, and the absolute power of the Blood of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I am a Child of the Living God, I am part of Your Kingdom. All of our enemies are outside of Your Kingdom and therefore, they have no right, no authority to even speek to me, a Child of the Living God!</p>

<p>I declare Your truth over my life. I plead the blood of Jesus over every place where the enemy has tried to gain ground. And I lift up my voice in worship — not because the battle is over, but because I know You’ve already won.</p>

<p>God, help me stand. When I’m tired, be my strength. When I’m discouraged, be my hope. When I’m tempted, be my way out. When I’m overwhelmed, be my peace. Remind me that You are not asking me to win the war — just to stand firm in You. You are my victory. You are my defender. You are the One who fights for me, even when I feel too weak to lift a finger.</p>

<p>Surround me with people who will help me fight — people who pray, who speak truth, who remind me who I am in You. Help me to be alert. Help me to guard my heart. Help me to stay grounded in Your Word, to continue to consume Your truth, to stay in communication with You, and to not give the enemy a single foothold.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not a life free from battles, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I learn to stand firm in every storm. One where I don’t crumble in the fight, but grow stronger because of it. One where I learn to trust You as my warrior, my refuge, and my strength.</p>

<p>Thank You for equipping me. Thank You for walking with me. Thank You that the battle is not mine, but Yours — and You never lose.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
