<h2>A Prayer of Praise for God’s Goodness</h2>

<p>God, You are good — not just because of what You do, but because of who You are. Your goodness is not a mood or a moment. It’s not based on circumstances. It is constant. Unchanging. Unshakable. And today, I want to pause and give You praise — for Your goodness, in every way, in every season, in every detail of my life.</p>

<p>Even when I don’t see it right away… You are good. Can only do good. Can be nothing but good. Will do nothing but good. Even when things don’t turn out like I hoped… You are still good. Even when I struggle, or stumble, or wonder why… Your goodness is not up for debate. It’s not something I get to vote on. It simply is who You are, what You are. You are always working for my good — even in the waiting, even in the refining, even in the storm. Even when things don't go according to my plans for my life.</p>

<p>I praise You for Your kindness, Your mercy, Your generosity. I praise You for all the ways You’ve provided — the seen and the unseen. For protecting me when I didn’t even know I was in danger. For giving me gifts I didn’t ask for. For withholding things that would have harmed me. For leading me gently when I thought I had to run. Thank You for showing up again and again — proving that Your goodness follows me all the days of my life.</p>

<p>God, help me to recognize Your goodness more. Help me to name it, remember it, and talk about it, and to praise and worship You for it. Help me build a habit of praise, a rhythm of worship, a life that points to You. Let Your goodness be the melody in my heart and the message of my story. When others look at me, let them see a person who knows, trusts, and rejoices in the goodness of God.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just a passing moment of gratitude, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where my praise is rooted in Your character, not just my circumstances. One where I trust Your goodness even when life is hard. One where Your goodness becomes the anchor of my soul.</p>

<p>Thank You, God, for being good — always, forever, without fail.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
