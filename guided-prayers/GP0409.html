<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Questioning God’s Plan</h2>

<p>God, I don’t understand. I know You’re in control. I know You have a plan. But right now, that plan feels confusing, hard, and nothing like what I expected. I’ve prayed. I’ve sought You. I’ve tried to follow… but the road You’ve led me down doesn’t look like the one I would have chosen. And honestly? I’m struggling with that.</p>

<p>It’s not that I think You’re wrong. I just don’t see what You see. I don’t know what You know. And from where I’m standing, it’s hard to imagine how this leads to anything good. I know Your Word says Your ways are higher than mine, but sometimes… I wish I could see what You’re doing, and know why Your doing it. I wish I could make sense of the pain, the delays, the closed doors, the waiting, the things that feel like setbacks or detours.</p>

<p>God, help me to trust You when the plan doesn’t make sense. Help me to follow You even when it hurts. Help me to remember that You are not obligated to explain anything, but You are faithful to walk with me through everything. Remind me that just because it’s hard doesn’t mean it’s wrong — and just because it hurts doesn’t mean You’ve abandoned me.</p>

<p>Teach me to trust, teach me to surrender — not just my actions, but my expectations. Help me release the version of life I thought I needed, that I was entitled to, so I can receive the one You’re writing for me. Lead me to scriptures and stories that remind me of how You’ve always been faithful, even when the path didn’t make sense. Bring people into my life who can testify to Your goodness on the other side of the unknown. Stir up a hunger for Your presence, not just Your plan.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just clarity or comfort, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where trust isn’t based on understanding, but on who You are. One where I stop needing all the answers, and start walking more closely with the Answer Himself.</p>

<p>Thank You for being patient with me. For not walking away when I question or wrestle. For being steady when everything else feels uncertain. I trust that even in this — especially in this — You are still good. You are still God. And You are still leading me… even when I don’t understand the way.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
