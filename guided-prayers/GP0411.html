<h2>A Prayer for When You’ve Never Believed</h2>

<p>God… if You’re real, I want to know. I’ve gone most of my life without You — or maybe just ignoring You. I’ve questioned, I’ve doubted, I’ve dismissed the whole idea of faith. Maybe I was hurt by people who said they followed You. Maybe I never saw a reason to believe. Maybe I just couldn’t believe in something I couldn’t see. But right now… I feel something. A tug. A crack in the wall I’ve built. A small, quiet voice asking, “What if?”</p>

<p>I don’t know how to do this. I don’t know how to pray, or what words to say, or what You’d even want from someone like me. But here I am. Honest. Unfiltered. Curious. Maybe even a little afraid. If You’re really there — if You truly know me, love me, created me — would You meet me here? Would You help me see what’s true?</p>

<p>I’m not looking for religion. I’m looking for something real. I’ve seen enough empty rules and fake smiles to last a lifetime. If You’re just another distant god who wants blind obedience, I’m not interested. But if You’re the God who knows my name, who sees my story, who can handle my doubt and walk with me in it — I want to know more.</p>

<p>So I’m asking You, with whatever mustard seed of openness I have: Show me who You are. Speak through the silence. Send people into my life who know You and reflect You well — not with judgment, but with grace and truth. Lead me to resources, stories, Scriptures, and conversations that help me understand what I’ve missed. Help me to be open, even if I’m skeptical. Help me to wrestle honestly, not hide behind excuses. And if You are who You say You are — if You are Jesus, the Savior, the Healer, the Redeemer — then don’t let me miss You.</p>

<p>I don’t have a lot of faith right now. But maybe faith doesn’t have to be big — maybe it just has to be real. So I bring You what I have, and I ask You to help me with what I don’t. I want to want You. I want to believe. Help me start there.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not religion, not guilt, not judgement, not pressure, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One built slowly, honestly, and deeply. One that can grow over time into something beautiful and true. If that’s real… I want it. And I want You.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
