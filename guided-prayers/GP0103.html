<h2>A Prayer for Loneliness</h2>

<p>God, I feel so alone. Whether I’m surrounded by people or sitting in silence, something inside me aches for connection. I smile when I need to, I show up where I’m expected, but deep down, I’m lonely. There’s an emptiness I can’t seem to shake — a longing to be truly seen, truly known, and truly loved.</p>

<p>There are moments I wonder if anyone would notice if I disappeared. Moments when I feel like I don’t belong anywhere. I know You’re supposed to be near, but honestly, it doesn’t always feel like You are. Sometimes the silence is louder than Your promises. Sometimes I can’t feel You at all — and that only makes the loneliness deeper.</p>

<p>But God, I bring that loneliness to You now. I lay it at Your feet. Not pretending. Not performing. Just being honest. You said You would never leave me. You said you would never forsake me. You said You would be close to the brokenhearted. You said You would be with me always. So I’m asking You to make that real for me again — not just in my head, but in my heart.</p>

<p>Help me to believe that I’m not forgotten. That You see me when no one else does. That You hear the thoughts I never say out loud. That You still have a place for me, even when I feel left out, overlooked, or invisible. Teach me how to rest in Your presence — not as a second-best substitute for human connection, but as the deep, satisfying, soul-level love I was made for.</p>

<p>God, I ask for courage to reach out. To risk connection. To be vulnerable even when I’ve been hurt. And I ask You to send people who reflect Your love — people who will sit with me in the silence and remind me I’m not alone.</p>

<p>But even if the answers don’t come right away, I will hold on to this: I am never truly alone, because You are here. You are the One who sticks closer than a brother. You are the One who holds every tear, every longing, every unspoken ache. And You are not going anywhere.</p>

<p>Thank You for loving me in the lonely places. For drawing near when I feel furthest away. I choose to trust that You are enough — even here.</p>

<p>Finally Father, help me to want what You want, to desire a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. To invest in and pursue this relationship with You. To fall even more in love with You each and every day.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
