<h2>A Prayer of Praise for Who God Is</h2>

<p>God, I praise You — not just for what You’ve done, but for who You are. Before the blessings, before the answers, before the breakthroughs, You are worthy. You are holy. You are faithful. You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I worship You — simply because You are God.</p>

<p>You are my Creator, my Sustainer, my Shepherd, my Refuge, my Deliverer, my Father. You are righteous and just, merciful and kind. You are powerful beyond measure and yet gentle with my heart. You are not distant or disinterested — You are Emmanuel, God with us. You never change. You never fail. You never forget. You never walk away. You are always good — even when life isn’t. Even when I'm not.</p>

<p>I praise You for Your wisdom that guides me, Your grace that covers me, and Your love that never gives up on me. I praise You for Your sovereignty — that You see the end from the beginning and hold all things together. I praise you because of Jesus, You have thrown my sins away as far as the east is from the west. I praise You because You are worthy — not just when I understand, but even when I don’t. Not just when I feel it, but even when I don’t. My praise isn’t based on my circumstances. It’s based on who You are — and You never change.</p>

<p>God, let my life become a song of praise to You. Let my worship flow from a heart that knows You and longs to know You more. Let me praise You not just with my words, but with my actions, my choices, my obedience. Let my daily life declare that You are God, and You are good. And when the world offers substitutes or distractions, remind me that nothing compares to You — no one loves like You, no one saves like You, no one reigns like You.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not shallow praise that depends on blessings, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One that praises You for Your character, not just Your gifts. One that sees You clearly and loves You deeply, no matter what.</p>

<p>Thank You for who You are. You are worthy of all my praise — forever and always.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
