<h2>A Prayer for When You Feel Like Giving Up</h2>

<p>God, I’m tired. Worn out in every way — mentally, emotionally, spiritually. I’ve fought and prayed and tried, but right now… I just want to quit. The weight I’m carrying feels too heavy. The path ahead feels too long. I don’t know if I have anything left.</p>

<p>I need You. I need Your strength where mine has run out. I need Your hope to carry me when I can’t find any in myself. I need Your voice to silence the lies that tell me I’m not enough, that it’s not worth it, that nothing will change. Speak louder than my discouragement. Be my courage when I don’t feel brave anymore.</p>

<p>God, I don’t want to give up — not really. Deep down, normally, I'm not a quitter, I'm a fighter, but I'm weary, I need your strength. I still want to believe there’s something beautiful on the other side of this. But right now, it just hurts, I'm weary, I'm frustrated, I feel like giving up, and giving into the lies. Help me Father, save me from this dispare, help me see You and Your beauty in and through all of this. I need You to remind me that You’re still working, even in the dark. That this valley won’t last forever. That You are with me in it, step by step, breath by breath.</p>

<p>Help me to let go of the pressure to perform, to be perfect, to hold it all together. I wasn’t meant to carry this alone. Teach me how to rest in You — not in a way that avoids responsibility, but in a way that remembers I’m not the Savior. You are.</p>

<p>Even if I can only take one more step, help me take it with You. Even if I can only whisper one more prayer, let it be for Your presence. Restore my soul. Renew my strength. Refocus my eyes on You — not the problem, not the pain, not the pressure — just You. I want to worship you. I want to praise you. Help my spirit to do just that.</p>

<p>I don’t want to quit, Lord. I want to keep going, but I want to do it with You. I want to want what You want — not just for this situation, but for my whole life. A strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You… that’s what I need most.</p>

<p>Thank You for not giving up on me. Thank You for staying close when I feel like running. Thank You for being the reason I can keep going.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
