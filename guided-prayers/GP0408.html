<h2>A Prayer for When You Feel Unseen by God</h2>

<p>God, I know You’re supposed to see everything… but right now, it feels like You’ve forgotten me. Like You’re blessing everyone else, answering everyone else, showing up for everyone else — and I’m just here. Waiting. Struggling. Invisible. I know it’s not true, but it feels true. And that feeling is heavy. It feels like rejection, but I know that is a lie, You would never reject someone You have Chosen! Never!</p>

<p>I try not to compare. I try to keep my eyes on You. But sometimes, seeing other people’s breakthroughs while I’m still waiting makes me feel left behind. I don’t want to envy. I don’t want to doubt. But when prayers go unanswered and silence stretches long, it’s hard not to wonder if I’ve slipped through the cracks — if I somehow missed Your notice or disappointed You without realizing it.</p>

<p>But Your Word says You are El Roi — the God who sees me. You saw Hagar when no one else did. You saw the woman who touched the hem of Jesus’ garment. You saw Zacchaeus in the tree. You see every tear I’ve cried. Every prayer I’ve whispered. Every burden I’ve carried silently. You see me… even when I feel unseen.</p>

<p>So today, I choose to believe that truth over my feelings. I choose to believe You’re near, even when I feel alone. I choose to believe You’re watching, even when I don’t feel noticed. I choose to believe that being seen by You is more valuable than being noticed by the world. And I ask You to help that belief sink deep down into my soul — beyond my doubts, beyond my emotions, beyond this season of silence.</p>

<p>God, if there are things You’re doing in me that I can’t yet see, give me patience. If You’re preparing me for something I’m not ready for, give me peace. And if You just want me to learn to be still in Your presence, teach me how to rest in the comfort of being fully known by You.</p>

<p>I want what You want — not just attention or affirmation, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I stop striving to be seen and start abiding in being loved. One where I find my worth not in being noticed, but in being Yours.</p>

<p>Thank You for seeing me, even in this. Thank You for never looking away. Thank You that I’ve never been out of Your sight — not for a single moment.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
