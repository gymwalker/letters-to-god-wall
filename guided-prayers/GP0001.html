<h2>A Prayer for When You’re Grieving</h2>

<p>God, I’m hurting. This loss runs deeper than I know how to carry.<br>
It aches in ways I can’t explain. It slows everything down. It steals my breath. 
It breaks my heart.</p>

<p>I know You understand grief. You’ve felt it more than anyone.  
You’ve wept over brokenness, betrayal, and death itself.  
But right now, Lord—this is my grief. And I need You and I ask You to be in it with me.</p>

<p>I need to know You’re here. Holding me. Lifting me. Not leaving me.  
I'm grateful that You’re not afraid of my tears, my silence, my anger, even my rage at something I do not understand.  
I need Your strength to carry this, because this burden is to heavy for me.</p>

<p>Help me remember that this pain—though overwhelming—is not forever.  
What feels eternal is only temporary. And what is eternal is Your love,  
Your promise, and Your presence that never lets go, that never fails.</p>

<p>I may not understand Your why, but I want to trust You in it.  
I don’t want to run from Your will—I want to rest in it.  
So not my will, Lord, but Yours. Even if I don’t like it. Even when it hurts. Even if it breaks my heart.</p>

<p>Teach me how to grieve without losing hope.  
Teach me how to hurt and still hold on.  
And Lord, as I walk through this valley,  
draw me closer to You than I’ve ever been before. Help me to rest in you, trust in you, surrender to you.</p>

<p>I want to know You here—not just on the other side of the pain,  
but *in* the pain. Right here. Right now.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
