<h3>A Prayer for When You Can’t Forgive Yourself</h3>

<p>God, I know You’ve forgiven me… but I haven’t forgiven myself, I can't seem to. I replay the moment over and over. I feel the guilt like it just happened yesterday. I hear the voices telling me I’m unworthy, they tell me that Your forgiveness is not "good enough" for what I have done, and I believe them. I know what Your Word says, but it’s hard to believe that something so broken can really be made whole again — that someone like me can really be free of my past sins.</p>

<p>It’s not that I doubt Your mercy. I just don’t think I deserve it. I know I'm not worthy of it either. And maybe that’s the point — I don’t and I'm not. But You give it anyway freely. Like second changes, like "get out of Jail Free cards." Not because I earned it, but because You love me. Because You chose me. Because You saw my worst moments and still said, “That one’s Mine.”</p>

<p>God, help me believe that, help me to own that. Help me believe what You say about me more than what shame screams in my head. Help me to put the shame down and walk away from it and run into your arms instead. Help me stop punishing myself for something You already paid for. Help me stop carrying guilt You already carried to the cross and had it nailed there. Help me stop holding myself to a standard of perfection that You never asked of me.</p>

<p>Father, I lay it all down now — the regret, the self-condemnation, the cruel words I’ve spoken to myself. I surrender the lies. I surrender the shame. I surrender this need to “pay You back” with suffering. And I receive Your grace. I receive Your love. I receive the truth that I am forgiven — completely, eternally, and without condition — because of Jesus.</p>

<p>Teach me how to walk in that freedom. Teach me how to let go of the past and live like someone who’s truly been set free. Replace the voice of the accuser with the voice of Your Spirit, reminding me that I am a new creation in Christ Jesus. The old has gone. The new has come.</p>

<p>God, I want what You want — not a life defined by guilt, and shame, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where I live as Your beloved child, not Your biggest disappointment. One where I learn to love myself again… because You never stopped.</p>

<p>Thank You for never giving up on me. For loving me even when I couldn’t love myself. I choose to trust Your voice over mine. I choose to believe that what Jesus did was enough — even for this. I declare Lord, You are enough.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
