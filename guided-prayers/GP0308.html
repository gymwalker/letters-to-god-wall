<h2>A Prayer for When You’ve Been Waiting</h2>

<p>God, I’ve been waiting... and it’s hard. I try to be patient, but it's hard, and apparently, I'm not very good at it as you can see. I’ve prayed, I’ve hoped, I’ve trusted — but nothing seems to be moving. I thought I’d be further along by now. I thought the answer would’ve come, the breakthrough would’ve happened, the door would’ve opened. But here I am, still waiting. Still wondering.</p>

<p>Sometimes I start to question if You hear me. Or if I’ve done something wrong. Or if maybe I misheard You entirely. But deep down, I know that You are not absent in the silence. You are not late. You are not withholding. You are working — even when I can’t see it.</p>

<p>So help me to wait well. Not with bitterness or impatience, but with trust. Help me to find Your joy in the waiting. Strengthen me while I wait. Refine me. Teach me to worship in the waiting, not just on the other side of it. Don’t let this season be wasted. Use it to shape my heart, deepen my faith, and draw me closer to You.</p>

<p>I confess that sometimes I want Your answers more than I want Your presence. So hurry up already! Just kidding, but you know what I mean. Change that in me. Help me to love You more than what I’m asking You for. Whether You say yes, no, or not yet — I want to walk through it with You. Because even if nothing changes, I know You are still good. I also know that You are growing me, refining me, pruning me, in the waiting. And we both know how much those things hurt. However, they are necessary if I want to bear fruit for You and Your Kingdom. So, continue my Lord, my Friend.</p>

<p>I want what You want — a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. And if waiting is what leads me there, then give me the courage to wait with hope, with joy, and the grace to stay faithful one day at a time.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
