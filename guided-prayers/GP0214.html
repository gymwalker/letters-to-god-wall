<h2>A Prayer to Break Free from Sin</h2>

<p>God, I’m tired of this cycle, the endless cycle. I sin, I feel guilty, I say I’ll do better — and then I fall again. I’ve tried to fix myself, but I can’t. I’ve tried to fight it on my own, but I always end up in the same place. I know it’s wrong. I know it separates me from You, because ALL SIN interferes with my relationship with You. And yet… I still run back to it. Like a slave returning to bondage and chains. My flesh is too strong for me, I need You and Your Spirit Living in me to fight for me. I need Your strength Father, for I have none of my own.</p>

<p>God, I don’t want to live like this anymore. I don’t want to keep choosing what I hate. I don't want to continue to invest in what I despise. I don’t want to numb the conviction. I want freedom — real, lasting, Spirit-led freedom. Not just to avoid the consequences, but because I miss being close to You. Because I want to love You more than I love my sin.</p>

<p>I confess my sin to You now — all of it. I bring it into the light. The patterns, the habits, the justifications, the secrecy, the pride, the shame. I lay it down at Your feet. You already know the truth, but I’m choosing to agree with You about it. It’s sin. It’s serious. It's offensive to You, my Lord, my Master, my Savior, my King, my Friend. And I’m done calling it anything else.</p>

<p>Jesus, thank You for the cross. Thank You for paying the price I could never pay. Thank You for breaking the power of sin and death. Thank You for loving me while I am still a sinner — and for loving me enough not to leave me in it.</p>

<p>Holy Spirit, fill me again. Give me new desires. Give me strength when I’m weak. Give me the courage to say no in the moment of temptation and to "choose" to say yes to what leads me closer to You. Help me to build new patterns — not just by willpower, but by Your power. Surround me with people who will walk with me, not shame me. Remind me that this fight isn’t over — and I don’t fight alone.</p>

<p>I want what You want, God — not just a behavior change, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One where holiness isn’t just an obligation, but a joyful response to Your love. One where obedience flows from trust, not fear. One where I stop hiding — and start healing.</p>

<p>Thank You for being patient with me. Thank You for Your mercy that is new every morning. Thank You for never letting go. I believe You can break this chain — and I believe You are breaking it now.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
