<h2>A Prayer for When You Feel Unloved</h2>

<p>God, I don’t know why I feel this way… but I do. Unlovable. Unwanted. Like I don’t matter. Like if I disappeared, the world would just keep moving — maybe even breathe a sigh of relief. I don’t like feeling this way. But sometimes, the silence from people I care about makes the lies feel true. And the longer it lasts, the harder it gets to believe that anyone — even You — could love someone like me.</p>

<p>I don’t want to believe those lies, God. But they feel so loud. I feel overlooked. Forgotten. Passed by. My heart hurts from being left out, ignored, misunderstood. And sometimes, even in a crowded room, I feel alone. Like I don’t belong anywhere. Like I’ll never be chosen, never be enough, never be truly seen.</p>

<p>But I bring all of that to You — the loneliness, the insecurity, the ache. Because I know You don’t just tolerate me… You love me. You chose me. You call me Your child. And You see what others miss. You know the parts of me I’m ashamed of — and You don’t turn away. You draw near.</p>

<p>Remind me, God, that I am loved — not because I’ve earned it, but because You are love. Not because I’m perfect, but because You are merciful. Not because of who I am, but because of who You are. I don’t need to compete for Your attention. I don’t need to be better to be wanted. I already have Your full heart. And You’re not going anywhere.</p>

<p>Heal the wounds that make it hard to receive love. Uproot the lies that keep me distant. Teach me how to let love in — not just from You, but from the people You send to reflect Your kindness. And when I don’t feel it, help me walk by truth instead of feelings. Help me to trust that Your love is deeper than my doubt.</p>

<p>God, I want to want what You want — a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. Fill every empty place with the fullness of Your presence. Let Your love redefine how I see myself. Let it be the anchor I run to — the truth I return to — no matter how the world makes me feel.</p>

<p>Thank You for loving me perfectly, fully, and forever. I believe You. Even here.</p>

<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
