**GP0218 – A Prayer for Letting Go of the Past**

<h2>A Prayer for Letting Go of the Past</h2>
<p>God, there are things I’m still holding onto — things I thought I let go of, things I thought I moved past, but they keep coming back. I'm dragging them around with me, and they are a heavy burden to me. The Scars. The Events. The pain. The regret. The memories. The words I can’t forget and the wounds I haven’t fully healed from. I play the victim. I blame everyone else, I even blame You. And I don’t want to carry them anymore.</p>
<p>I know I can’t change what happened. I know I can’t undo the choices I made or the ones that were made for me. But God, I need Your help to release their grip on me. To let the burden go, to put it down, to walk away from it. I need You to meet me in the places where the past still stings and show me how to live free — not just forgiven, but truly free.</p>
<p>Teach me how to grieve what needs to be grieved, not to hold onto it, not to play with it, not to mourn it, and not to stay stuck in sorrow. Teach me how to remember without reliving. How to learn without being defined by what I’ve walked through. I don’t want to be the person who keeps looking backward. I want to be someone who moves forward — with You. Help me to know and understand, the past is just that, IN THE PAST. Help me to learn from it, not dwell on it. Help me to live with You in the present. To keep an eye on the future, but not dwell on it. My focus should be the here and the now, right now, this minute, this second. That is what is important. Yesterday is gone. Help me to leave it there.</p>
<p>God, if there’s still unforgiveness in me, bring it into the light. If there’s still bitterness buried deep, pull it up by the roots. If there is anger still in me, help me to forgive and release it all to you. If I’ve built my identity around what I’ve survived instead of who You say I am, then break those false foundations. I want Your truth to define me — not my past.</p>
<p>Let Your healing go deep. Speak to the parts of me still frozen in those old chapters. Restore what was stolen. Redeem what was broken. And release me from anything that keeps me from living the life You’ve called me to now.</p>
<p>I want what You want — not a life of regret or replaying old pain, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. A life marked by Your mercy, shaped by Your grace, and anchored in Your presence.</p>
<p>Thank You for already forgiving what I still struggle to forget. Help me to move forward — not alone, but with You leading the way.</p>
<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>

**GP0411 – A Prayer for When You’ve Never Believed**

<h2>A Prayer for When You’ve Never Believed</h2>
<p>God… if You’re real, I want to know. I’ve gone most of my life without You — or maybe just ignoring You. I’ve questioned, I’ve doubted, I’ve dismissed the whole idea of faith. Maybe I was hurt by people who said they followed You. Maybe I never saw a reason to believe. Maybe I just couldn’t believe in something I couldn’t see. But right now… I feel something. A tug. A crack in the wall I’ve built. A small, quiet voice asking, “What if?”</p>
<p>I don’t know how to do this. I don’t know how to pray, or what words to say, or what You’d even want from someone like me. But here I am. Honest. Unfiltered. Curious. Maybe even a little afraid. If You’re really there — if You truly know me, love me, created me — would You meet me here? Would You help me see what’s true?</p>
<p>I’m not looking for religion. I’m looking for something real. I’ve seen enough empty rules and fake smiles to last a lifetime. If You’re just another distant god who wants blind obedience, I’m not interested. But if You’re the God who knows my name, who sees my story, who can handle my doubt and walk with me in it — I want to know more.</p>
<p>So I’m asking You, with whatever mustard seed of openness I have: Show me who You are. Speak through the silence. Send people into my life who know You and reflect You well — not with judgment, but with grace and truth. Lead me to resources, stories, Scriptures, and conversations that help me understand what I’ve missed. Help me to be open, even if I’m skeptical. Help me to wrestle honestly, not hide behind excuses. And if You are who You say You are — if You are Jesus, the Savior, the Healer, the Redeemer — then don’t let me miss You.</p>
<p>I don’t have a lot of faith right now. But maybe faith doesn’t have to be big — maybe it just has to be real. So I bring You what I have, and I ask You to help me with what I don’t. I want to want You. I want to believe. Help me start there.</p>
<p>I want what You want — not religion, not guilt, not judgement, not pressure, but a strong, close, deep, loving, personal, passionate, intimate relationship with You. One built slowly, honestly, and deeply. One that can grow over time into something beautiful and true. If that’s real… I want it. And I want You.</p>
<p>In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
